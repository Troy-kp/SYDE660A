# Program Data Optimization Analysis - Final Report

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive analysis comparing SYDE's detailed program format with the existing `program_data` JSON files, **the current formats are NOT optimal** and require significant enhancements to match SYDE's level of detail and functionality.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ SYDE Format Advantages (Current Best Practice)
```json
{
  "program_name": "Master of Engineering (MEng) in Systems Design Engineering",
  "url": "https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/graduate-studies/catalog#/programs/r1fjl10Cj2",
  "degree_rules": {
    "total_courses": 8,
    "level_constraints": {"max_500_level": 2, "description": "..."},
    "departmental_constraints": {"min_syde_courses": 2, "description": "..."},
    "requirements": [
      {"type": "compulsory", "courses": ["SYDE 600"], "n_to_choose": 1, "description": "..."},
      {"type": "compulsory_choice", "courses": ["SYDE 660A", "SYDE 660B", ...], "n_to_choose": 1},
      {"type": "elective", "courses": [], "n_to_choose": 6, "description": "..."}
    ]
  },
  "specializations": [
    {
      "name": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning",
      "total_courses": 4,
      "requirements": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### ‚ùå Other Programs Format Limitations
```json
{
  "Chemical_Engineering_MEng": {
    "specified_fixed": ["CHE 600 - Title"],
    "specified_choose": [{"count": 1, "options": ["CHE 601", "CHE 602"]}],
    "elective": {"min_count": 7, "list": ["descriptions"], "note": "constraints"}
  },
  "Biological_Engineering": {
    "specified_fixed": ["CHE 562", "CHE 660", "CHE 663"],
    "elective": {"min_count": 1, "list": ["CHE 561", "CHE 564"]}
  }
}
```

## Critical Missing Information

### 1. **Program-Level Metadata** (‚ùå Missing in all non-SYDE programs)
- Program name and official URL
- Total course requirements
- Program duration and structure

### 2. **Structured Constraints** (‚ùå Missing structured format)
- Level constraints (500-level course limits)
- Departmental course requirements  
- Grade requirements (averages, minimums)
- Course validity time limits

### 3. **Milestone Requirements** (‚ùå Completely missing)
- Seminar attendance requirements
- Other non-course milestones
- Documentation requirements

### 4. **Course Weight Information** (‚ùå Missing precision)
- Special credit weights (e.g., CHE 600 = 0.25 credits)
- Course load calculations

### 5. **Additional Program Information** (‚ùå Missing context)
- Funding expectations
- Specialization limits
- Special approval requirements

## Detailed Comparison: Chemical Engineering

### Original Format (Current)
```json
{
  "Chemical_Engineering_MEng": {
    "specified_fixed": ["CHE 600 - Engineering and Research Methods..."],
    "specified_choose": [{"count": 1, "options": ["CHE 601 - Transport", "CHE 602 - Reactor"]}],
    "elective": {
      "min_count": 7,
      "list": ["4 graduate level CHE courses", "3 graduate level electives"],
      "note": "Of the 7 electives, 4 must be CHE courses. No more than 2 total may be 500 level courses."
    }
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Format (Recommended)
```json
{
  "program_name": "Master of Engineering (MEng) in Chemical Engineering",
  "url": "https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/graduate-studies/catalog#/programs/Bysg1CAon",
  "degree_rules": {
    "total_courses": 8,
    "level_constraints": {"max_500_level": 2, "description": "No more than 2 may be 500 level courses."},
    "departmental_constraints": {"min_che_courses": 4, "description": "Of the 7 electives, 4 must be CHE courses."},
    "grade_requirements": {"minimum_average": 70, "minimum_individual": 65},
    "requirements": [
      {"type": "compulsory", "courses": ["CHE 600"], "credit_weight": 0.25},
      {"type": "compulsory_choice", "courses": ["CHE 601", "CHE 602"], "n_to_choose": 1},
      {"type": "elective", "n_to_choose": 7}
    ]
  },
  "milestone_requirements": {
    "seminar_attendance": {"required_seminars": 12, "description": "..."}
  }
}
```

## Enhancement Priority Recommendations

### üî¥ High Priority (Critical for System Functionality)

1. **Add Program Metadata**
   - Include `program_name`, `url`, `total_courses` for all programs
   - **Impact**: Enables consistent UI display and program identification
   - **Effort**: Low - direct data extraction

2. **Implement Structured Constraints**
   - Convert text-based notes to structured `level_constraints` and `departmental_constraints`
   - **Impact**: Enables automatic validation and better error messages
   - **Effort**: Medium - requires parsing existing notes

### üü° Medium Priority (Important for Completeness)

3. **Add Grade Requirements**
   - Include minimum averages and individual course grade requirements
   - **Impact**: Complete academic planning information
   - **Effort**: Low - extracted from original details

4. **Include Milestone Requirements**
   - Add seminar attendance and other non-course requirements
   - **Impact**: Complete degree requirement tracking
   - **Effort**: Medium - requires detailed program analysis

### üü¢ Low Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Course Weight Specification**
   - Include credit weights for special courses
   - **Impact**: Precise credit calculations
   - **Effort**: Medium - course-by-course verification needed

## Programs Requiring Enhancement

All engineering programs except SYDE need enhancement:

- ‚ùå **Chemical Engineering** - Missing 7 key information types
- ‚ùå **Electrical and Computer Engineering** - 9 specializations but no metadata/constraints
- ‚ùå **Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering** - 4 specializations but no structure
- ‚ùå **Civil and Environmental Engineering** - 4 specializations but no metadata
- ‚ùå **Management Science and Engineering** - Minimal structure

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Metadata Enhancement (High Priority)
1. Extract program names, URLs, and total courses from original details
2. Add to existing JSON files maintaining current structure
3. Test compatibility with existing course planning system

### Phase 2: Constraint Structuring (High Priority)
1. Parse existing note fields to extract constraints
2. Convert to structured format matching SYDE
3. Update course validation logic to use structured constraints

### Phase 3: Complete Enhancement (Medium Priority)
1. Add milestone requirements from original details
2. Include grade requirements and additional information
3. Align all programs with SYDE's comprehensive format

## Example Enhanced Implementation

I created a demonstration enhanced Chemical Engineering file at:
`data/program_data/Chemical_Engineering_enhanced.json`

This shows how the program would look with SYDE-level detail, including:
- ‚úÖ Complete program metadata
- ‚úÖ Structured degree rules and constraints  
- ‚úÖ Detailed specialization requirements
- ‚úÖ Milestone requirements
- ‚úÖ Additional program information

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Enhancement
- **Consistency**: All programs follow same structure as SYDE
- **Functionality**: Enable advanced validation and planning features
- **Maintainability**: Easier to add new programs and features
- **User Experience**: Better error messages and program information display
- **Data Quality**: Complete and accurate program information

### Implementation Effort
- **High Priority Changes**: ~2-3 days of work
- **Complete Enhancement**: ~1-2 weeks for all programs
- **Testing and Validation**: ~1 week
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 2-4 weeks

## Conclusion

**The existing `program_data` formats are NOT optimal.** While they work for basic functionality, they lack the depth and structure that SYDE provides. Significant enhancements are recommended to:

1. **Achieve consistency** across all engineering programs
2. **Enable advanced features** like constraint validation
3. **Improve user experience** with better information display
4. **Future-proof the system** for new requirements

The enhanced format demonstrated with Chemical Engineering shows the potential for a much more robust and complete program data structure that matches SYDE's excellent standard.

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize High Priority enhancements** (metadata and constraints)
2. **Start with Chemical Engineering** as the pilot program
3. **Test enhanced format** with existing course planning functionality
4. **Roll out systematically** to other engineering programs
5. **Update documentation** and code to handle enhanced format

This enhancement would bring all engineering programs to the same high standard currently enjoyed by SYDE students and enable much richer course planning functionality across the entire Faculty of Engineering.

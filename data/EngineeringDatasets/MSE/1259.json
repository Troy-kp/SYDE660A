It focuses on the development of modeling skills, the interpretation of results, sensitivity analysis and computer implementations of decision support systems. Topics include linear, integer and network optimization models. Simulation analysis and other topics in stochastic processes may also be covered. The use of quantitative models in different levels of the decision making hierarchy are illustrated through case studies and readings from the Management Sciences literature. Priority may be given to Management Sciences students.",

It discusses matters such as natural light and ventilation or the short- and long-term behaviours of building materials, and assesses the use of new generations of \"smart\" mechanical environmental devices.

The course is intended to provide students with an advanced knowledge base in contemporary architectural theory to ground more specialized graduate elective coursework while acting as a support for thesis and other forms of advanced architectural research.",

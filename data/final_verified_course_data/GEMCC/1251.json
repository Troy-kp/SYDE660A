        "description": "This course examines the scientific and practical challenges of finding and utilizing climate data to derive useful information in order to inform research and decision making processes. Through lectures, readings, videos and assignments, this course will introduce different types of climate data (historical, contemporary measurements and modelled) and discuss how they can be realistically analyzed to derive useful information (both within a research and policy context). From a general discussion on what climate data is and its value, this course will then focus on finding/collected climate data and critically evaluating how it can and should be used. Further, this course will introduce students to the development of data management plans, climate data curation, and effective ways of visualizing and contextualizing climate data to a variety of target audiences. Building upon this foundational knowledge, strategies and methodologies for analyzing climate data to derive useful information related climate risk in a variety of sectors with be explored. This includes areas such as community planning, human health, engineering/infrastructure among others. Students must have access to spreadsheet software for assignments. *eligible for MES.",

The transition to more sustainable cities is both fraught with challenges, including the legacy of unsustainable infrastructure and deeply entrenched habits, but also exciting opportunities and potential for innovation. In this course, we explore the challenge of urban sustainability transitions through a systems lens, exploring the technologies, governance models, values, and behaviours that might trigger and accelerate the transition. We look around the world for compelling examples of sustainability transitions in practice, from Malmö to Melbourne, and apply the lessons we learn to the Canadian context.",

The scientific and practical challenges of utilizing climate information for decision-making in government policy, community planning, business operations, and international development, as well as the technical standards and professional ethics associated with providing climate services, are examined. Students gain practical experience in the development and application of climate services through climate data assembly and interpretation.",

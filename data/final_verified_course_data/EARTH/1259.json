Particular attention will be given to microscopy, X-ray, and spectroscopy techniques. The use of these techniques in the study of microbe-mineral-fluid interactions, and the impact of these interactions on the broader environment, will be explored. Implementing a multi-analytical approach to investigate topics in the biogeosciences will be practiced through research design.",

It devotes considerable attention to analytical techniques for describing univariate and bivariate distributions, including the use of kernel density estimators and scatterplots.  The course addresses statistical inference using multivariate regressions, covering a series of techniques and issues of particular significance in the analysis of microdata.  Examples include Monte Carlo methods; bootstrapping; the use of sampling weight; omitted variable bias; measurement error; and instrumental variables.  Completion of an empirical project is a course requirement.",

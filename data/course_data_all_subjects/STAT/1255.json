Topics covered include independence of random variables, conditional expectation and the determination of the distribution of functions of random variables using the cumulative distribution method, change of variable and moment generating functions. Properties of the Multinomial and Bivariate Normal distributions are proved. Limiting distributions, including convergence in probability and convergence in distribution, are discussed. Important results, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the Delta Method, are introduced with applications. The maximum likelihood method is discussed for the multi-parameter case. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are examined and used to construct confidence intervals or regions.

It provides an understanding and appreciation of the essential statistical concepts needed for Data Science. It has modular design with the following modules: probability for statistics, concepts of statistical inference, simulation and Monte Carlo methods, regression modelling, planning empirical studies, and drawing conclusions from data. Emphasis will be on exposing students to the core concepts and illustrating them largely through examples.",

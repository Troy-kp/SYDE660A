Through the reading of memoirs, students with an interest in aging, health care, and the therapeutic professions will grapple with the profound impact that caregiving during illness has on carers and relationships across the spectrum - from young carers, to intimate partners, to adult children caring for aging parents, and beyond. Discussions will be grounded in the social, legal, and policy contexts.",

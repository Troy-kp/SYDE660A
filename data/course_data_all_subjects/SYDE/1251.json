Applications are used for explaining how the foregoing models are fitted to both natural and socio-economic time series by following the identification, estimation and diagnostic check stages of model construction. Other topics include simulation in engineering design, forecasting in the operation of large-scale projects, and environmental impact assessment.",

Students in this course will learn multiple methods in cognitive engineering with an emphasis on knowing the differences in foundation, assumptions and appropriate application of the methods.  Students will be expected to apply the methods in a realistic research context, applying for ethics clearance and working with actual participants.  Examples of appropriate topics may include understanding how people work with complex or automated systems models. Finally this course discusses aspects of the current research environment in cognitive engineering, with the objective of developing successful future researchers in this area.",

Topics include: review of kinematics, dynamics and graph theoretic (GT) methods; application to one-dimensional mechanical systems; GT representation of two-dimensional components and systems; formulation and solution of governing system equations; extension to three dimensional mechanical systems with flexible bodies and mechatronic components; application to kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms, robotic manipulators, vehicles and satellites.",

In this course you will learn how robust design methods and mathematical models of engineering systems help find improved designs at a lower cost.  Topics include: the building of simple, efficient, meta-models through computer experiments to replace traditional mechanistic models.  Performance measures and their design specifications.  Sensitivity and importance analysis to select design variables.  Second moment methods using Taylor series to provide parameter (mean) design.  Probabilistic methods combined with manufacturing and scrap costs to perform simultaneous parameter design and tolerance allocation.  Desirability functions and loss functions to deal with multiple competing performance measures.  Integrated design by constrained optimization.  Examples come from industrial processes, as well as hydraulic, electrical and mechatronic systems.  Mathematics required: Total derivatives, Matrix calculus, Kronecker product, singular value decomposition.  Matlab serves as the computing tool.  Course notes are available.",

Video streams are analyzed as dynamic systems, linear and non-linear.  If the system can be approximated as linear and Gaussian in terms of the dynamic noise in the process and measurement, then Kalman filter techniques are used.  This refers to sequential state estimation.  For nonlinear dynamical systems, the EFK (Extended Kalman filter) can be used by a liberalization of the stat space model.  Particle filters are used to address state estimation problems where the systems are non-linear and non-Gaussian.  Particle Filters are rooted in Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo procedures.  The course builds upon these techniques in studying visual tracking and the components of Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) procedures.",

Critical Design can intersect with and draw on established fields of design from graphic and UX design to industrial and urban design. The course begins with an overview of the history of design as critique, before examining the recent emergence of research-creation practices such as speculative design, critical making, discursive design, and applied media theory. The positionality of designers and audiences will be considered in readings and assignments that focus on gender, disability, race, and class. Special attention will be paid to the design of media technologies and the infrastructures that support them,\nwhich involves methods in UX design, sustainable hardware design, and digital urban design. Students will demonstrate their knowledge of course materials through writing, design, and light fabrication.",

We will cover variable selection techniques, including for high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on regularization techniques such as the LASSO and its variants. Model validation, both internal and external, and model updating will be covered, and we will also discuss post-model selection inference. An important focus will be on biomarker evaluation for a given disease, potentially connected to therapy, and leading to coverage of precision/personalized medicine.

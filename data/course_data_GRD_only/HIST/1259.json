        "description": "This seminar offers a comparative analysis of insurgency and counterinsurgency from the 19th century to the present.  It examines resistance to foreign invaders in Europe, the century of rebellion in Mexico in 1810-1917, anti-colonial wars of national liberation, Marxist revolutionary movements in South-East Asia and Latin America, the upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism and urban guerrilla warfare.  The course will focus on the sources of insurgencies, their nature and the support they drew from various social groups.  In each case, the government's response will also be investigated.  We will analyse theories of guerrilla thinkers and pacification models and pay particular attention to the gap between intended and actual policies, and the plight of civilians caught in crossfire.",

You will read works informed by cultural theory, especially concerning the occupation of social space and the expression of experience of particularized social identities.  Each week, we will meet together in seminar to discuss the substance, theoretical orientation, methodology, and historiographical significance of the assigned material.  As such, active reading and constructive participation in seminar are key.  In addition, you will be required to lead seminar discussions and write an historiographical paper.",

The course explores how historians use narrative to (re)construct past realities.  It looks closely at the uses, abuses, and limitations of microhistory as a genre and exposes students to important trends in social history.  Though the bulk of the material deals with Europe in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, the course is methodological in nature and is intended for all graduate students of social history.\r\n\r\nStudents in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie's Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence's The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg's Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.  In addition, HIST 622 exposes students to the various non-historical theorists (sociological, anthropological, etc.) whose works inform the microhistorical method.",

Given these questions, and the almost endless scope of a course that purports to take the world as its focal point, weekly seminars will begin with a discussion of the possibilities offered by as well as the limits to transnational/global/world history, the various interpretative frameworks in use and their proponents as well as the challenges that transnational/global/world history poses.  We will then focus on particular case studies or themes so as to promote discussion that is as much historiographical as it is historical. Such themes/case studies may include:  feminism and imperialism, famine and climate change, disease and ecology, military technology and governmentally, global trade and the rise of consumer society(s), colonial knowledge and shifting ideas of race.",

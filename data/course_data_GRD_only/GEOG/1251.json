The focus of qualitative research is not descriptive measurement and prediction of phenomena, as offered by statistical description/analysis, but is more attuned to examining subjective understandings and the interpretation of meaning (hermeneutics). This course will examine and evaluate the range of research tools comprising qualitative methods including: various interviewing methods, participant observation, ethnography, case study methods and dicourse analysis.

Students will learn about the sources and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients along the aquatic (stream-river-lake) continuum, and ecological responses in receiving water bodies. Environmental thresholds for setting water-quality standards and nutrient criteria will be discussed. Students will learn about agricultural beneficial management practices and wastewater management to reduce nutrient inputs to freshwaters. Students will examine the benefits and challenges of sustainable nutrient stewardship in combatting eutrophication, and learn about how this knowledge is used in water-quality management, through international examples.",

        "description": "This advanced graduate seminar examines the emergent possibilities associated with work in cities of the future. It theorizes the central role that work plays in everyday urban life, highlighting how work is spatially and socially unevenly distributed and how inequality continues to structure labor markets in cities. It engages with `future of work¿ discourses to examine the complex role of technological change in urban labor market transition, as well as questioning the prominence of technological change in such transition. It focuses both on sectors privileged by mainstream theories of urban development (e.g., high technology and the creative industries) and sectors ignored by such theories but that nevertheless remain essential for the functioning of urban centers, including unpaid, informal, and care work. It questions the  role of work in everyday life by highlighting dominant working norms and resistance to them, e.g., in calls for redistributive justice through unionization and collective action, anti-work discourses, and campaigns for a four-day work week.",

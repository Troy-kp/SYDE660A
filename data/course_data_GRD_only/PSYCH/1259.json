For example, children can pretend that a banana is a telephone, that their juice is in an empty cup, or that a clean teddybear is dirty.  Although pretence is often taken for granted, and perhaps considered childish, it is mysterious: How do children pretend, and purposely represent the world as different than it really is?  And how are children able to recognize what others pretend?  Are children behaviourists about pretend play? Or does successful pretence signal that your children engage in mental state reasoning ('theory of mind')?  Theories of children's (and adults') pretence have sought to provide answers to the questions.  These theories are still actively debated, and are the main topic of this course.  Relevant experimental work will also be discussed.",

The course follows a model testing approach in which parameters for full and restricted models are predicted, and the adequacy of the models compared. Concepts such as power, effect size, error rates, contrasts, trend analyses, nonorthogonality, and so forth are discussed for higher-order, between and within -subjects designs. Special attention is given to analyses with multiple dependent variables (MANOVA). Finally, the application of randomization tests is presented as an alternative to theoretical distributions of test statistics, and the relationships of ANOVA and multiple regression techniques are also examined for simple and complex designs.",

The ability to reason about beliefs, desires, and other mental states is often called \"theory of mind.\"  How this ability develops in childhood, has been greatly debated over the past 20 years, and remains mysterious (e.g. how can we learn that people have mental states when we cannot see mental states, but only infer them by observing people's behaviour).  This course will mainly concern the development of theory of mind in childhood, and we will discuss the major empirical discoveries and theoretical positions in this area of investigation.",

This field is characterized by enormous breath of content, unique methodological and statistical challenges and, perhaps most importantly, the need for meta-theories around which major empirical findings can be integrated and organized. The purpose of this seminar is three fold: (1) to familiarize students with classical and contemporary theorizing in the field of close relationships; (2) to read and critique some of the best research in the field; and (3) to identify what critical questions must be asked - and eventually answered - if a more coherent and integrated science of relationships is to emerge.",

        "description": "Since the dawn of psychology as a science, conceptual and methodological questions have accompanied research at the intersection of culture and psychology. In the past, studying the relationship between culture and psychology has been difficult due to sampling restrictions and response biases. Since these challenges have been mastered, a wealth of research has accumulated on how culture influences cognition, emotion, and the self. We will first review and discuss this work. We will next discuss a set of new challenges for culture and psychology. Such challenges include questions about conceptual clarity, within-cultural and sub-cultural variations (e.g., variations due to social status, class, religion, or political affiliation), differentiation and integration of processes at the group vs. individual level of analysis, modeling of how cultural processes unfold over time, and integration of insights from etic and emic methodological approaches. The final goal of this seminar will be to propose ways to address these challenges, ideally in a form of mini-research projects presented at the end of the class.",

Until recently, it has not been in focus of psychological inquiry. Traditionally, this topic has remained in the domain of philosophy. Indeed, philo - sophia translates as love of wisdom. Philosophers tend to take a normative stand. In contrast, psychologists tend to explore the variations in the psychological processes underlying wisdom. We will focus on the unique combination of these approaches to understand what wisdom may be and how it may be obtained, and explore the distribution of wisdom-related processes in the domain of difficult life experiences and in daily life.",

Students will develop a holistic perspective on \"family therapy intervention\", with particular emphasis on Structural and Emotion-Focused Family Therapy. Direct clinical work and case review will be emphasized. Specifically, students will have opportunity for direct (i.e., \"face to face\") clinical contact, either with their own or a shared (co-therapy) client at the CMHRT.

    "description": "The theory and application of time-series modelling are presented for describing phenomena measured at discrete points in time. The types of time-series models include stationary auto regressive moving average (ARMA), nonstationary, special families of seasonal, transfer function-noise (multiple inputs-single output), intervention, and multivariate (multiple inputs-multiple output) models. Applications are used for explaining how the foregoing models are fitted to both natural and socio-economic time series by following the identification, estimation and diagnostic check stages of model construction. Other topics include simulation in engineering design, forecasting in the operation of large-scale projects, and environmental impact assessment.",

Particular emphasis is placed on understanding representation, nonlinear computation, and dynamics in real neurobiological systems. Students will apply signal processing, control theory, linear algebra, probability theory, and similar quantitative tools for the purpose of modelling sensory, motor, and cognitive systems. Topics covered include single neuron function, neural coding, neural dynamics, attractor networks, learning, statistical inference, locomotion, working memory, etc. Familiarity with neural systems is helpful but not essential.

This proposal includes a review of the relevant literature, the methodology and project timeline. Where applicable, students obtain ethics approval for their research project. Each field study includes conducting a situation analysis, developing a sustainability strategic plan for the organization. A Faculty member assists each team. Students deliver field study project results as a report to both the organization and the course instructor. Individual students also complete a short reflection paper including a discussion of the case in relation to the application of sustainability frameworks and literature.",

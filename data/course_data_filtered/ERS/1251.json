The primary focus will be the development and understanding of generalized linear models as they are foundational to most analyses in Environment and Ecology. Students will learn to fit models to data and assess model fit. Students will also be introduced to the use of the statistical software R and provided the opportunity to use that software to manage and analyze their own data. Special topics will be developed based on the needs and interests of the students and may include hierarchical modelling, multivariate statistics, survey analysis, non-linear modelling, or other topics. Students are expected to bring their own computer and data. For cases in which data have not been collected, students will work with the professor to source similar data or generate simulated data to support their progress through the course.",

Qualitative methods attempt to interpret meaning as opposed to purely measuring phenomena. The focus of qualitative research is not descriptive measurement and prediction of phenomena, as offered by statistical description/analysis, but is more attuned to examining subjective understandings and the interpretation of meaning (hermeneutics). This course will examine and evaluate the range of research tools comprising qualitative methods including: various interviewing methods, participant observation, ethnography, case study methods and dicourse analysis. It will also engage with the theoretical debates and philosophical approaches that underpin qualitative research.",

Case studies are used to illustrate solutions for realizing sustainability, emphasizing efforts underway for reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The course assesses four intersecting and sometimes competing approaches for realizing sustainability: technological innovation; market-based approaches; state regulation and investment; and individual and collective (\"grassroots\") action. Key values underlying sustainability are explored, including notions of the \"good life\", democracy, social justice, and efficiency.",

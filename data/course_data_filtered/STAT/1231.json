We will cover variable selection techniques, including for high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on regularization techniques such as the LASSO and its variants. Model validation, both internal and external, and model updating will be covered, and we will also discuss post-model selection inference. An important focus will be on biomarker evaluation for a given disease, potentially connected to therapy, and leading to coverage of precision/personalized medicine.

    "description": "Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to create representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Deep learning usually refers to a set of algorithms and computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers. These methods have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in many domains including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, Classification, Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics. This course will cover the modern practice of deep networks, different architectures of deep networks including feed forward and convolutional models, methods for sequence modeling, variational and adversarial models, attention mechanism and optimization and regularization for deep models.",

Properties of the Multinomial and Bivariate Normal distributions are proved. Limiting distributions, including convergence in probability and convergence in distribution, are discussed. Important results, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the Delta Method, are introduced with applications. The maximum likelihood method is discussed for the multi-parameter case. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are examined and used to construct confidence intervals or regions.

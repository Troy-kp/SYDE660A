Students learn about different approaches to design project and team management and communication, as well as the relationship between design and environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Students gain experience in the entire design cycle by working on a number of small design problems throughout the term. Students form teams and work on a term-long project centred on need finding and problem formulation. This activity is expected to result in a project topic that can be further developed in the capstone design series of courses (MSE401/402).",

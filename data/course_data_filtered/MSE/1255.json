This course provides students with the background and tools needed to critically evaluate issues in S&T policy debates. After reviewing the basics of science and technology policy, we will discuss a few instruments of S&T policy, e.g., intellectual property rights, tax and subsidy, public funding for research, and prizes. Throughout the course, we will integrate the theoretical discussions with cases of contemporary S&T policy issues. Previous study of economics is required, such as MSCI 607.",

One focus of this course is multi-tier software architectures, such as websites and other software as a service (SaaS) systems. Students will learn common software concepts such as design patterns, and modelling processes, objects, logic, and data. Students will learn how to organize data in a RDBMS and how to interact with the database using the structured query language (SQL).",

It covers quantitative information displays, conditional probability and Bayes' rule, transforms, joint distributions, special discrete and continuous distributions (t, F, chi-square, Poisson), fitting distributions to data, maximum likelihood estimation, multiple regression, experimental design (blocking, factorial), paired hypothesis tests, analysis of variance, non-parametric statistics, and computer intensive statistics (bootstrap). In addition, students learn how to clean data, handle missing values, smooth data, and perform the statistical techniques covered in the course using a statistical computing package (e.g., R). Emphasis is placed on working with actual data collected from student experiments and other sources such as industrial partners.",

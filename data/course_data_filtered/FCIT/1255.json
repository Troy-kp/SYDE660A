    "description": "Building on their learning in Systems and Futures thinking, students will travel to one or more cities that showcase leading-edge sustainability solutions and provide innovative, resilient strategies to prepare for a changing world. The site for the international field school will vary from year to year, but will be outside of Canada. FCIT 610 will have co-instructors ¿ one who is an expert in the futures space, the other may or may not have futures experience but will have lived experience in or familiarity with the destination city. Programming will include site visits, conversations with sustainable city leaders in different sectors (for example transportation, waste management, climate mitigation, housing, public health, food systems) and case study specific learning modules. Supplemental preparatory reference materials will position how the adoption of forward leaning approaches was achieved within specific contextual circumstances. The course is run as an intensive block course. Note: this course will include an additional field trip fee to cover the cost of travel and accommodation, the amount will vary depending on the location.",

    "descriptionAbbreviated": "The Socially Just City",
    "description": "This course explores efforts by urban planners, policy-makers and social movement organizations to envision and create socially just cities. Cities emerge through historical power relations, including contradictions between production (capital accumulation) and socio-ecological reproduction. They are places of hope, wealth accumulation, innovation and cultural vibrancy. But, as we will explore, cities are characterized by social struggles over: the uneven distribution of wealth and opportunities; a desire for deeper democratic participation; inequitable access to services and public space; unequal distribution of environmental benefits and harms; increasing state and corporate surveillance; philosophies and practices of security, policing and incarceration; and related discriminatory processes according to people¿s gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability and (legal) status. We draw on case studies from cities around the world to critically assess progressive policies, programs and grassroots-led initiatives aimed at resolving these conflicts. This course focuses on solutions aimed at: increasing affordable housing and access to public transportation; redistributing wealth (e.g., through tax policy and public ownership); creating good jobs; planning for equity; and deepening participatory urban governance.",

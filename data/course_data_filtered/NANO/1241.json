    "description": "Introduction to structure of nanoscale materials (crystal, surface and electronic) from an interdisciplinary perspective. Fundamentals introduced and used to discuss the design and fabrication of electronic devices, more complex surfaces/interfaces and case studies. Covers electronic structure of nanoscale materials, including metals, insulators, semiconductors and conductive polymers, and methodologies and approaches to their spectroscopic study. Interaction of electro-magnetic radiation and quantum-mechanical particles and matter. Methodologies include optical, x-ray and electron spectroscopic/spectro-microscopic methods, including epifluorescence, confocal scanning microscopy, near-field scanning optical microscopy, scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.",

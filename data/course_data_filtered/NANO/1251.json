Analytical tools to explore the possibilities of NEMS. Includes methodology to derive and use MEMS and NEMS models as design tools, basic concepts of statics and dynamics needed to construct lumped-mass models, the use of reduced-order models in MEMS/NEMS design, advantages and disadvantages of these techniques versus commercial software (COMSOL, ANSYS, and Coventor), most effective uses and limitations for each modeling approach.",

    "description": "Introduction to structure of nanoscale materials (crystal, surface and electronic) from an interdisciplinary perspective. Fundamentals introduced and used to discuss the design and fabrication of electronic devices, more complex surfaces/interfaces and case studies. Covers electronic structure of nanoscale materials, including metals, insulators, semiconductors and conductive polymers, and methodologies and approaches to their spectroscopic study. Interaction of electro-magnetic radiation and quantum-mechanical particles and matter. Methodologies include optical, x-ray and electron spectroscopic/spectro-microscopic methods, including epifluorescence, confocal scanning microscopy, near-field scanning optical microscopy, scanning transmission x-ray microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.",

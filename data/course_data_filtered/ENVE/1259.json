    "description": "Students undertake an independent environmental engineering design project during the last two terms of their plan. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate students' abilities to practise in an environmental engineering capacity in their chosen area of expertise, using knowledge gained from their academic and employment experiences. The first part of the project (ENVE400) will include problem identification, generation and selection of solutions, and time management. Incorporation of technical, ecological, social, political, and economic issues in the solution for the project will be required. A basic requirement of the proposed solution is that it must be compatible with the principles of sustainability. Requirements include proposal, progress report, and a final report containing recommendations for part two of the project (ENVE401).",

The determination of hydrological parameters in the liquid and vapour phases such precipitiation, soild moisture, surface water, and evaporation/evapotranspiration from remote sensing, as well as the integration of remote sensing data into hydrological models are also covered.  Prerequisites: UW undergraduates: GEOG 271, 371, 471 or undergraduate Geomatics degree.  Undergraduate Geography degree with suitable remote sensing experience. Students with no remote sensing experience but strong GIS experience are required to take a 675 Directed Reading course entitled \"Remote Sensing Analysis\" prior to enrolment in 602. *eligible for MES.",

Qualitative methods attempt to interpret meaning as opposed to purely measuring phenomena.  The focus of qualitative research is not descriptive measurement and prediction of phenomena, as offered by statistical description/analysis, but is more attuned to examining subjective understandings and the interpretation of meaning (hermeneutics).  This course will examine and evaluate the range of research tools comprising qualitative methods including: various interviewing methods, participant observation, ethnography, case study methods and dicourse analysis.  It will also engage with the theoretical debates and philosophical approaches that underpin qualitative research.",

    "description": "Climate change is a pervasive factor affecting the future of society. Recognizing that dangerous climate change cannot be avoided through greenhouse gas emissions reductions alone, adaptation to climate change has emerged as a central component of global climate policy. An in depth understanding of the diverse impacts of climate change on communities, economic sectors and society will provide a foundation for examining adaptation strategies to build resilience to accelerated climate change. Examples will draw from multiple sectors in both developed and developing world contexts, with an emphasis on solutions and the limits to adaptation.",

The scientific and practical challenges of utilizing climate information for decision-making in government policy, community planning, business operations, and international development, as well as the technical standards and professional ethics associated with providing climate services, are examined.

    "description": "Wildfire is a global phenomenon that is expected to increase in extent and severity due to fuel accumulation, shifting land management practices, and climate change. Removal of vegetation by wildfire can alter hydrologic, biogeochemical, and geomorphic processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales in a manner that can be transient or persistent. Alteration of these processes can involve complex responses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which pose significant financial, environmental, planning, and management challenges. This course will examine the role of climate warming on wildfire behaviour, the impacts of wildfire on landscape form and function, and its impact on hydrologic and geomorphic processes in wildfire impacted landscapes across the globe.",

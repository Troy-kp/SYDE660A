    "description": "This course examines the ways in which environmental challenges are being addressed by means of 'global governance' - that is, international organizations and institutions intended to deal with these environmental challenges. Concepts are investigated both to help analyze the relative strengths and weaknesses of existing structures and to suggest ways in which alternative forms of global governance might advance sustainability. Specific organizations and other actors presently active in global environmental governance are given particular attention, as is the management of selected global environmental challenges.",

A review of the implications of our emerging knowledge abut complex systems in three governance domains - energy, climate, and security.  The first component surveys the major branches of thought about complexity in physics, biology, ecology, geography, information theory, technology studies, and economics.  The second component highlights practical applications of complexity science in global governance, emphasizing research findings with clear policy implications.  The course includes some exposure to computational methods of modeling complex phenomena and visualizing complex data.  Assignments include three short integrative reports and a major paper.",

The course starts by illustrating how the concepts of cooperation and adaptation are manifested in nature and how such models are inspiring new types of solutions methods. Topics to be covered include: search algorithms, game playing, constraints satisfaction, meta-heuristics, evolutionary computing methods, swarm intelligence, ant-colony algorithms, particle swarm methods, adaptive and learning algorithms and the use of these algorithms in solving continuous and discrete problems that arise in engineering applications.

    "description": "Conventional approaches for tackling complex systems are usually implemented under the assumption of a good understanding of the process dynamics/functionalities and its operating environment.  These techniques fail, however, to provide satisfactory results when applied to ill-defined processes (for which analytical and experimental modeling may not be easily obtained) that may operate in unpredictable and possibly noisy environment.  Recent developments in the area of intelligent systems and soft computing have presented powerful alternatives for dealing with the behavior of this class of systems.  This course outlines fundamentals of soft computing based design approaches using such tools as approximate reasoning, fuzzy inferencing, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and neuro-fuzzy systems.  Fundamentals and advances on these procedures are outlined along with their potential applications to various real world applications in virtually most fields of engineering including pattern recognition, system planning, classification, power generation, intelligent transportation, systems and control, intelligent mechatronics, optimization, communication, robotics and manufacturing, to name a few.",

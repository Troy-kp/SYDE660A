    "description": "Experimental variability is examined using a back-to-basics approach showing the fundamental meaning of statistical concepts like mean, standard deviation, and significance. With this foundation, there will be a deeper dive into different techniques to understand data though significance testing, experimental design, typical data distributions, processing non-normal data, and experimental design and analysis. The course will end with a discussion of data visualization, discussing how to maximize the effectiveness of data communication by discussing the theories underpinning effective data communication, matching plotting techniques to presented data and best plotting practices to highlight conclusions. The course concepts will be underpinned by project work to apply the class concept to real-life datasets and figures.",

    "description": "The course offers a comprehensive study of different machine learning techniques used for a variety of engineering applications. The theoretical aspect of the course introduces the students to topics such as supervised (shallow and deep) learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this course, implementation of these machine learning tools in image processing, robotics motion planning and control applications will be discussed. Implementation of machine learning algorithms using resources available in machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch will also be introduced through several assignments that students will tackle during the term.",

This approach allows students to gain better understanding of the impacts of policies, wars, and conflicts on people's lives and rights. Students will examine notions of power, borders, belonging, memory, and home while engaging with narratives of loss, exile, and yet resilience. Additionally, students will develop a greater awareness of the ethics of writing about and presenting on refugees and forcibly displaced individuals which they will be encouraged to apply in their research and reflective papers, presentations, and during discussion sessions.",

Students will engage with longer passages of adapted and unadapted texts, thereby consolidating their theoretical and practical understanding of grammar and internalize conventional translation techniques. Students also will strengthen their ability to master linguistic problems systematically. Students will complete the study of ancient Greek grammar on the basis of the course book and thus be prepared to read and translate Greek authors in GRK202/RCS224, and further studies.",

    "description": "This course provides student leaders with a practical framework to analyze and understand their role in their service organization, either in Waterloo Engineering or outside, to become better leaders in the future.  The course is structured for students to both develop and apply reflective practices to their student leadership experiences   using the SLICC (Student-Led, Individually-Created Course) model and circle pedagogy.  Classroom time is used for discussions, workshops, guest presenters, and peer-to-peer learning experiences from discussions of the weekÂ¿s topic to formal presentations.  Typical topics include positionality and power, conflict and inter-personal relationships, emotional intelligence, leadership and management, communication, teamwork, and succession planning.  Participation in all in-person sessions and submitting weekly reflections are expected. Main deliverables include weekly reflections, SLICC proposal and final report, as well as presentations and peer feedback on SLICC projects.",

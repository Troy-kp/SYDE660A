This course focuses on some of the opportunities and challenges associated with the integration of climate change into urban and rural planning, including climate vulnerability of urban systems, low-carbon transport systems, urban greening and green infrastructure for climate resilience, regenerative designs that reduce social vulnerability, the role of information and communication technologies for system efficiency and resilience, and assessing synergies and conflicts between mitigation and adaptation. Leading policy and design cases from communities across Canada and internationally will be examined.",

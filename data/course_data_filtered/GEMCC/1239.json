The course includes organization emission reduction target setting strategies; techniques and standards for organizational GHG inventories with reference to international-regional-sectoral reporting/trading schemes; auditing and verification processes; GHG information management systems; evolving expectations and approaches to disclosure of GHG emissions; supply-chain carbon accounting; and evolving carbon markets (voluntary, sectoral and regulated).",

This course will review the environmental issues associated with chemical industries and the roles of engineers to manage these issues. The principles and philosophy of green chemistry will be addressed including pollution prevention in unit operations. The concepts and practices of environmental life cycle analysis and accounting will be addressed in detail, together with the basics of risk assessment, management and communication. ",

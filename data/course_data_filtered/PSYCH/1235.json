Disorders of perception and vision such as agnosias, of attention such as neglect, of language such as apshasias and dyslexias, of memory as in dementias, and amnesia, and of higher-order functions as in callosal split brain patients will be considered.  We will also examine the relationship between findings from case studies and neuroimaging of cognitive functions.  By reviewing and discussing theoretical implications of classic and current research in neuropsychology, students will develop an understanding of how a patient-based approach can inform current theories of human cognition.",

It will consider the patterns of Indigenous-Newcomer relations, the nature and origins of treaties, and Indigenous protests against external incursions into traditional territories.  The course will focus on developments around the world in the period after World War II, and will examine such themes as the emergence of Indigenous rights movements, the origins and status of legal claims, political accommodations and international efforts to address Indigenous aspirations.  Particular attention will be paid to the development of international Indigenous organizations, coordinated protests and challenges to national governments, and the engagement of international organizations (i.e., through the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples).",

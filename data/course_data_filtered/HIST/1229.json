    "description": "This seminar offers a comparative analysis of insurgency and counterinsurgency from the 19th century to the present.  It examines resistance to foreign invaders in Europe, the century of rebellion in Mexico in 1810-1917, anti-colonial wars of national liberation, Marxist revolutionary movements in South-East Asia and Latin America, the upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism and urban guerrilla warfare.  The course will focus on the sources of insurgencies, their nature and the support they drew from various social groups.  In each case, the government's response will also be investigated.  We will analyse theories of guerrilla thinkers and pacification models and pay particular attention to the gap between intended and actual policies, and the plight of civilians caught in crossfire.",

It looks at global forces influencing particular societies and encourages students to place themselves outside conventional local, regional, and national boundaries, and will critically consider a number of the metanarratives that have informed and continue to inform historiography, particularly idea such as modernity, progress, and the ongoing preoccupation with the 'rise of the west'.  Given these questions, and the almost endless scope of a course that purports to take the world as its focal point, weekly seminars will begin with a discussion of the possibilities offered by as well as the limits to transnational/global/world history, the various interpretative frameworks in use and their proponents as well as the challenges that transnational/global/world history poses.  We will then focus on particular case studies or themes so as to promote discussion that is as much historiographical as it is historical. Such themes/case studies may include:  feminism and imperialism, famine and climate change, disease and ecology, military technology and governmentally, global trade and the rise of consumer society(s), colonial knowledge and shifting ideas of race.",

Students will explore how the prison became a nearly universal institution, considering the ways in which colonialism was a driving force for its expansion. They will examine how colonial powers presented prisons as symbols of \"civilization\" and \"modernity,\" as well as how they became sites of anti-colonial resistance. Students will investigate these themes through case studies drawn from a range of geographical areas and time periods. A variety of sources will be used including academic texts, memoirs, media, poetry, visual sources, music, and film. The course will develop students' methodological skillset and their ability to critically examine the connections between penal institutions, power, and knowledge production. Overall, this course will help students to understand the place of the prison in our global society, past and present.",

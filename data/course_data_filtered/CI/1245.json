    "description": "Modern societies have had to confront terrible histories of human rights abuses, where one group has sought to oppress and/or eliminate another because of ethnic, religious, or political differences. Truth and reconciliation commissions or similar mechanisms rely on story to express and make sense of the horrors of large-scale human rights abuses. In this course, we will examine and discuss the role of fictional narratives in contributing to the truth and reconciliation discourses of countries from around the world.",

    "descriptionAbbreviated": "Truth-Reconciliation-Story",
    "description": "Modern societies have had to confront terrible histories of human rights abuses, where one group has sought to oppress and/or eliminate another because of ethnic, religious, or political differences. Truth and reconciliation commissions, or similar mechanisms, have shown the power stories have to honour people's experiences and integrate them into dominant narratives of identity. This course will examine how cultural production (film, literature, and the arts) helps to make sense of these violent histories and the cultural values and practices that allowed them to happen.",

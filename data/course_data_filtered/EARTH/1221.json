Numerical techniques including finite difference, finite element, and particle tracking methods are studied and applied to the solution of problems in groundwater flow, aquifer mechanics, flownet generation, and advective-dispersive transport. Proper modelling approaches, error analysis, stability, discretization constraints, pitfalls, and model misuse are discussed. Students will be developing some of their own groundwater models, and will be obtaining hands-on experience with state-of-the-art interactive groundwater models in the PC laboratory. Prior experience with FORTRAN is essential. Recommended: MATH 111B or equivalent. Students without the required prerequisite may seek consent of the instructor.",

Topics related to variably-saturated flow will focus on: derivation of Richard's equation, a control volume finite difference discretization, assembly and solution of the flow equation, material balance error, truncation error analysis, stability and monotonicity. Topics related to contaminant transport will focus on: derivation of the contaminant transport equation, a control volume finite difference discretization along with various spatial and temporal weighting schemes and their associated accuracy, monotonicity, and material balance error. Hands on experience is provided using software applied to industry-standard variably-saturated flow and transport problems, with an emphasis on visualization and interpretation of results.

The content will be interdisciplinary and quantitative, with a strong focus on biogeochemical processes that influence the chemical composition and quality of water at different stages of the global water cycle; the content will also include aspects of microbiology, ecology, hydrology and geology. Students will be introduced to geochemical modelling tools used to interpret changes to water quality through the application of equilibrium thermodynamics. [Offered: W]",

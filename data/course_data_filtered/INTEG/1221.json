The course will cover a broad range of issues from a social scientific perspective, including comparisons of different types of deceptive information; the role that cognitive biases and social networks play in shaping our perceptions of truth and reality; the importance of data rights, privacy, and governance models for social media platforms and other digital communications; misrepresentations of science; and how influence campaigns undermine political deliberation and democratic institutions. This course will provide students with knowledge and fundamental skills that are important for countering bullshit, biases, and bad arguments.",

    "description": "This course introduces students to state-of-the-art scientific research on learning and cognitive adaptability. We will discuss how to develop \"smart\" goals, improve memory, reduce cognitive biases, cultivate a growth mindset, and enhance self-regulation. These cognitive strategies are essential for becoming a more effective learner; however, they are not the whole story. We will also look at the ways physical health, mental well-being, and social connections affect the ability to learn, remember, create, and problem-solve. Finally, we will discuss how to thrive in university, both inside and outside the classroom. Students who take this course will develop an appreciation for how the psychological sciences can enhance learning, and they will acquire the skills needed to improve oneÂ¿s own thinking and well-being.",

These include: effective communication in groups, proactively managing group conflict, identifying biases that hinder creativity, and leveraging diversity to improve outcomes. You will also put those skills into practice throughout the course and reflect on how you can apply them in other situations.",

The course will cover both abstract and practical issues related to methodology and decision making in empirical research. You will have the opportunity to develop and workshop proposals that you may wish to pursue in your senior honours thesis. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods.",

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course is intended to engage and advance knowledge and practice in Indigenous health with a focus on social justice. Students will learn about health inequities that face First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit Peoples in rural and urban contexts within Canada as well as Indigenous Peoples internationally who have been impacted by processes of colonization. The course will critically examine how health status indicators are  measured and used as well as link determinants of Indigenous Peoples' health to historical and ongoing colonial priorities and practices. Some of the disparities in health and social issues, access to care, and systemic challenges including racism experienced by Indigenous Peoples in different regions and contexts will be shared as points for discussion. An intersectionality lens will be applied in consideration of the unique health experiences among Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous women, youth, and Two Spirit people. Innovative approaches to healing and community-based ethical practices will also be profiled in social work and health care delivery, research, policy, and programming. The perspectives of Indigenous Peoples will be highlighted in this course, through a variety of readings, film and other arts-based narratives, including Indigenous scholars and community activists in the delivery and discussion of course materials.",

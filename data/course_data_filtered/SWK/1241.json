    "description": "This course examines practice models and multi-level methods of intervention for effective social work practice in health care, including health promotion, disease prevention, assessment treatment, rehabilitation, continuing care, and discharge planning within the context of social, economic, environmental, and cultural variations. The distribution and determinants, as well as psychological and behavioural aspects of health and disease across the life span are addressed. Practice models incorporate competence and empowerment as central themes. Different practice models of care are explored within the context of socio-cultural factors that inform health and well-being. Differences between the concepts of illness and disease are explored within the healthcare narrative. Resource allocation in the management of chronic and complex health conditions is examined, and interventions that support individual and family capacity to adapt to health crises or chronic health conditions are considered.\n(Note: This is an online course).",

    "description": "This course considers the nature of health itself, and explores the complexities of a health care system that corresponds with social work values and ethics while remaining sustainable. Three related themes serve as substrates for the semester: the nature of health, delivery of health care, and specific health experiences that are characterized by inequity, societal change, and/or a\nparticular ethical dilemma. Issues such as how health and illness are defined, cultural safety, the roles of preventive and curative approaches, and the impacts and ethics of new technologies and societal change will be addressed. The course critiques public, private, and individualized models of health, focuses on community health care, and examines the particular challenges of marginalized communities.

    "description": "The goal of this course is to deepen students' knowledge of the ways in which research can be produced, used, and disseminated in social work practice. The course will address research ethics, theories, and methods, and examine how different approaches can influence relationships and practices across community and health care settings. Students will develop their abilities to assess existing research studies, and will explore how they can engage in new research as social workers. Activities include literature reviews, interviews, surveys, and knowledge dissemination strategies. Particular attention will be paid to program evaluation and knowledge mobilization, and to how these may be used to improve services and further social justice in students' own organizations and communities.

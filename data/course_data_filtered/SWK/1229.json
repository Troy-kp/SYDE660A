    "description": "This course explores health inequity within a Canadian context. It engages critical debates on key concepts related to health inequity including diversity, equity, access, and inclusion. The ultimate goal of this examination is to support students understanding of the social and structural determinants of health and the ways in which uneven access to these determinants are implicated in health inequities for equity-seeking groups, and consequently, social injustice. The course centers the learner as a pivotal agent in changing social structures that sustain health inequities. (Note: This is an intensive on campus course with an\nonline component).",

The distribution and determinants, as well as psychological and behavioural aspects of health and disease across the life span are addressed. Practice models incorporate competence and empowerment as central themes. Different practice models of care are explored within the context of socio-cultural factors that inform health and well-being. Differences between the concepts of illness and disease are explored within the healthcare narrative. Resource allocation in the management of chronic and complex health conditions is examined, and interventions that support individual and family capacity to adapt to health crises or chronic health conditions are considered.\n(Note: This is an online course).",

Issues such as how health and illness are defined, cultural safety, the roles of preventive and curative approaches, and the impacts and ethics of new technologies and societal change will be addressed.

Case examples will be drawn from the experience of families across the cancer illness trajectory, from diagnosis through to death and dying, bereavement and long term survivorship. Small group work will allow student to develop a rich understanding of the cancer experience from the perspective of families, as well as competency in family assessment, intervention, interprofessional collaboration, and cultural safety.

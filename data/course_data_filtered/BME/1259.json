Where applicable, common sources of impairments of each system (e.g., pathologies, aging, etc.) will be presented along with implications for diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative technologies (and universal design). Students will be required to perform engineering design that applies their knowledge in biology and physiology that they have gained throughout the course.",

The vast amount of data gathered with the advance of experimental technologies, in the search for a general understanding of the complex cell mechanism at the molecular level, have often made the traditional way of direct interpretation impossible. Therefore, recent years have seen significant efforts made to understand these data with more sophisticated mathematical models, using fundamental physical laws and engineering analytic techniques. This course is an introduction to some of the successful achievements of these approaches, and the exciting potential outcomes of this line of research.",

The full model development and application cycle is considered:  Pre-processing, understanding, and generating input forcing data; system discretization and algorithms for simulating hydrologic processes;  parameter estimation; and interpreting model output in the context of often significant system uncertainty.  The course will include practical applications of models to alpine, boreal forest, prairie, and agricultural settings in Canada.",

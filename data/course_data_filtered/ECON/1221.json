Topics covered include basic concepts in time series analysis (modelling volatility and trend), VAR Modes (including structural VAR's), VECM and Cointegration, neural networks and estimation of DSGE models.  During the course, students will have the opportunity to explore several case studies using econometric software such as RATS and MATLAB.",

Recent studies suggest that much legislation is consistent with simple welfare concepts developed by economists.

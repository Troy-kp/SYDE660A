Students will learn how to estimate and interpret dynamic models and how these models affect our ability to do inference. The course also covers methods for data in which the response variable is either qualitative, with or without multiple levels, or count data. For that purpose, it introduces students to maximum likelihood estimation, and the estimation of models by probit, logit, and Poisson regressions.

The properties of such equilibria are explored, both in terms of model logic (existence, uniqueness) as well as in terms of the desirability of the equilibrium outcomes (efficiency, welfare).

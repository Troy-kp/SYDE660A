It teaches the use of a database management system (DBMS) by treating it as a black box, focusing only on its functionality and its interfaces. Topics include introduction to database systems, relational database systems, database design methodology, SQL and interfaces, database application development, concept of transactions, ODBC, JDBC, database tuning, database administration, and current topics (distributed databases, data warehouses, data mining).",

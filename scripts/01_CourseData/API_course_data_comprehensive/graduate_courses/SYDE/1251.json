Topics include: the building of simple, efficient, meta-models through computer experiments to replace traditional mechanistic models.  Performance measures and their design specifications.  Sensitivity and importance analysis to select design variables.  Second moment methods using Taylor series to provide parameter (mean) design.  Probabilistic methods combined with manufacturing and scrap costs to perform simultaneous parameter design and tolerance allocation.  Desirability functions and loss functions to deal with multiple competing performance measures.  Integrated design by constrained optimization.  Examples come from industrial processes, as well as hydraulic, electrical and mechatronic systems.

This refers to sequential state estimation.  For nonlinear dynamical systems, the EFK (Extended Kalman filter) can be used by a liberalization of the stat space model.  Particle filters are used to address state estimation problems where the systems are non-linear and non-Gaussian.  Particle Filters are rooted in Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo procedures.

The course begins with an overview of the history of design as critique, before examining the recent emergence of research-creation practices such as speculative design, critical making, discursive design, and applied media theory. The positionality of designers and audiences will be considered in readings and assignments that focus on gender, disability, race, and class. Special attention will be paid to the design of media technologies and the infrastructures that support them,\nwhich involves methods in UX design, sustainable hardware design, and digital urban design.

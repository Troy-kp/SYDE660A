The project will be completed in an industrial laboratory under the supervision of a suitably qualified staff scientist and a university co-supervisor.  The topic for the project will be arranged in consultation with the candidate and through negotiation with the candidate's employer.  A substantial report on the project and a verbal presentation at the University are required.  The industrial research project is equivalent to two half-term courses.",

    "description": "This course gives a broad treatment of the subject of engineering decision, risk, and reliability.  Emphasis is on (1) the modelling of engineering problems and evaluation of system performance under conditions of uncertainty; (2) systematic development of design criteria, explicitly taking into account the significance of uncertainty; and (3) logical framework for risk assessment and risk-benefit tradeoffs in decision making.  The necessary mathematical concepts are developed in the context of engineering problems.",

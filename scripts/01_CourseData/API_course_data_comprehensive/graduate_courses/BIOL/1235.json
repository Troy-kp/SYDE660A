The course will be given in two sections, in different terms; Topic 1: Life Science Research Skills (fall of a student's first year) and Topic 2: Scientific presentation (winter of a student's second or third year).  The participants are expected to also attend and participate in the weekly \"Biology Brown Bag Gathering\" which is a forum for students and post doctoral fellows to present their research results or lead discussions on current topics of general interest.  This series will start each fall with a presentation on \"How to give a talk\".",

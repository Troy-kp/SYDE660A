This will lead to methods for evaluating the performance of various types of statistical models and learning techniques/algorithms. Cross-validation and bootstrap approaches will be introduced for model performance evaluation, and we will discuss discrimination and calibration as different components of prediction performance. We will cover variable selection techniques, including for high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on regularization techniques such as the LASSO and its variants. Model validation, both internal and external, and model updating will be covered, and we will also discuss post-model selection inference. An important focus will be on biomarker evaluation for a given disease, potentially connected to therapy, and leading to coverage of precision/personalized medicine. Finally, there will be coverage on the importance of reproducible and replicable research. Examples from different problems in health, including genetics, will be presented, and software (e.g. R or SAS) will be used throughout the course.",

Students will largely work in pairs to progress through each step involved (with feedback from instructors at each stage) and to produce a final systematic review and meta-analysis to be presented/submitted at the end of the course.  \r\nCourse Objectives:\r\n1.  To demonstrate an understanding of the rationale underlying a systematic review and meta-analysis and relevance to clinical care and health policy;\r\n2.  To critically appraise a systematic review;\r\n3.  To develop a focused research question amenable to a systematic review;\r\n4.  To develop and implement a comprehensive and systematic literature search strategy;\r\n5.  To determine and apply procedures for including/excluding potential studies for a systematic review and meta-analysis;\r\n6.  To develop and implement a data abstraction process and study database;\r\n7.  To demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental statistical/biostatistical issues relevant to the conduct of a formal systematic review and meta-analysis.\r\n8.  To perform statistical analyses for a systematic review and meta-analysis and complete/present a final report demonstrating all stages involved.\r\n\r\nStudents will need to meet with Course Coordinators and provide of appropriate previous experience with linear and/or logistic regression techniques.",

Like almost every organization in every sector, governments at all levels around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to this digital disruption, and the changing public expectations that come with it, while still making sure critically important systems - including social services, public infrastructure, financial operations, and democratic governance - are still stable and solid for the people, communities and businesses that rely on them every day. The future of the public service is one that acknowledges that these systems need change, but that change can only come from new ways of working, of approaching challenges, and of understanding the relationship between public and public service. The digital era has not only ushered in new public expectations of government, but an ever-present need for the public service to renew itself to meet those expectations. This course will explore what government can and should look like in a digital era, while also examining how this digital transformation is already being done, but inside the public sector and beyond.",

Through practice-based learning, students will identify leverage points for change-making as they build their capacity for distributed knowledge and action. They will also\ndevelop professional skills required to lead collaborative teams in the context of designing and implementing urban sustainability initiatives. The course is delivered in modules focusing on systems analysis, problem identification in uncertain futures, team collaboration, as well as effective virtual and live engagement and participation processes. Students will build their knowledge of the characteristics of effective strategic decision making in multi-stakeholder contexts.",

    "description": "Through theory and practice, this progressive project-based course will introduce foresight methods used in the development of strategic proposals related to urban sustainability. Working in teams, students will identify an issue in a specific predefined sector. Their exploration and research begins with a divergent process of signal discovery of emerging issues and trends through methods such as environmental scanning, new technology research, user research, field study, or stakeholder workshops. In a subsequent convergent process, students will then learn and apply methodologies, including medium-to long-range exploratory scenario planning, to develop insights and implications for action. A strategic innovation response will then be stress tested against scenarios to evaluate effectiveness and systemic fit for the defined urban context. Students will develop futures literacy skills to make sense of complex emergence and gain confidence in their ability to frame positive responses to change.",

    "description": "This course explores efforts by urban planners, policy-makers and social movement organizations to envision and create socially just cities. Cities emerge through historical power relations, including contradictions between production (capital accumulation) and socio-ecological reproduction. They are places of hope, wealth accumulation, innovation and cultural vibrancy. But, as we will explore, cities are characterized by social struggles over: the uneven distribution of wealth and opportunities; a desire for deeper democratic participation; inequitable access to services and public space; unequal distribution of environmental benefits and harms; increasing state and corporate surveillance; philosophies and practices of security, policing and incarceration; and related discriminatory processes according to peopleÂ¿s gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability and (legal) status. We draw on case studies from cities around the world to critically assess progressive policies, programs and grassroots-led initiatives aimed at resolving these conflicts. This course focuses on solutions aimed at: increasing affordable housing and access to public transportation; redistributing wealth (e.g., through tax policy and public ownership); creating good jobs; planning for equity; and deepening participatory urban governance.",

It theorizes the central role that work plays in everyday urban life, highlighting how work is spatially and socially unevenly distributed and how inequality continues to structure labor markets in cities. It engages with `future of workÂ¿ discourses to examine the complex role of technological change in urban labor market transition, as well as questioning the prominence of technological change in such transition. It focuses both on sectors privileged by mainstream theories of urban development (e.g., high technology and the creative industries) and sectors ignored by such theories but that nevertheless remain essential for the functioning of urban centers, including unpaid, informal, and care work. It questions the  role of work in everyday life by highlighting dominant working norms and resistance to them, e.g., in calls for redistributive justice through unionization and collective action, anti-work discourses, and campaigns for a four-day work week.",

The transition to more sustainable cities is both fraught with challenges, including the legacy of unsustainable infrastructure and deeply entrenched habits, but also exciting opportunities and potential for innovation. In this course, we explore the challenge of urban sustainability transitions through a systems lens, exploring the technologies, governance models, values, and behaviours that might trigger and accelerate the transition. We look around the world for compelling examples of sustainability transitions in practice, from MalmÃ¶ to Melbourne, and apply the lessons we learn to the Canadian context.",

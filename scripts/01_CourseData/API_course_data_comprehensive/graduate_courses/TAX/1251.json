    "description": "This course investigates the Canadian tax system in light of the objectives of that system.  For any current tax rule, the idea is to identify the underlying policy problem the rule is intended to solve, consider alternative solutions, and then determine if the current tax rule can be improved.  Students will apply this procedure in a major essay.  In class, topics discussed will include: the process of formulating tax policy and the roles of Finance; CCRA; courts, lobby groups, etc.; the goals of taxation such as fairness and neutrality; tax evasion and the underground economy; flat taxes and single-rate taxes versus progressive-rate taxes; and implementing incentives through the tax system versus as direct government expenditures.  This course is intended to make students think about the purpose of tax rules.  Tax rules are just so many random bits of information unless you understand the purpose of the rules.  Understanding the purpose helps you remember the rules and makes you better able to explain them to clients.  Also, by identifying gaps and inconsistencies where the rules do not achieve their purpose, you may be able to identify tax planning opportunities and areas where the rules may change in the future.",

Given the existing level and the continual expansion of cross-border trade and investment by Canadian companies, particularly in the age of electronic commerce, an understanding of international taxation is vital for every tax practitioner and business advisor.  International Tax II builds on the fundamental principles taught in International Tax I. The course examines in more detail the foreign affiliate and foreign accrual property income rules and practices that apply to Canadian companies seeking to establish, expand, structure and finance their foreign operations in a tax efficient manner.  The course challenges students to explore the implications and planning opportunities under the Canadian rules and to learn how these rules interact with foreign tax law.  The course also examines how Canadian companies can make effective use of low-tax jurisdictions in international tax planning to own and to finance foreign operations.  Finally, the course explores how domestic and international developments and rules, such as transfer pricing, might impact such planning currently and in the future.",

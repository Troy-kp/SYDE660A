    "description": "This course provides an overview of current issues and operational challenges associated with aeronautical research, aviation operations and management, policy and governance, and economics. The objective of the course is to provide a foundational knowledge base of the structure, terminology, theories, and\npractices of the air transport system. This course will facilitate an understanding of how various disciplines apply to aeronautics, facilitate interdisciplinary discussions and group work, and establish a foundation to allow learners to apply their discipline to address aeronautical issues. Interdisciplinary faculty members, industry guest speakers, and government professionals will be invited to share various perspectives on contemporary aeronautical issues.",

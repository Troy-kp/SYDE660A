Using case studies of artisanal production and industrial design and manufacture, and addressing the possibilities and limitations of the computer as a design and production tool in architecture, this seminar draws out a discourse on the cultural momentum of composition and representation, and the fabrication of architectural forms in both virtual and material realities, establishing provisional guidelines for their interplay.

Rapid prototyping techniques will include laser cutting, three-dimensional printing and CNC 3-axis machining.

Together, we will focus on identifying opportunities for innovative collaborations and tangible improvements to the design of urban environments.  The school is especially interested in strengthening collaboration among universities, community residents, planning and design practitioners, and policymkaers to seize their own destiny to design, model, and plan.  Accordingly, we will investigate thematic (e.g. urban revitalization, design/aesthetics, environmental/greening, gentrification, housing, and multiculturalism) and policy-oriented areas (e.g. urban design guidelines, new urbanism, intensification, and land-use development patterns) that relate to the mid-size city.  This is a seminar-based course and student participation is key to it's success.",

    "description": "The built world and the inner world are linked, and have the potential to touch us through the act of design.  The inspiration and meaning for the creative designs we need are available from the psyche but we have not been given the tools to access these resources and bring them into the built world.  The purpose of this elective is to connect architects with new pathways and creative tools for bringing their imagination into the world.  This course presents a psychological view of the built world in order to help architects understand the wisdom of their dreams, shadows and body during the process of design.  Its in-depth approach allows the architect to experience the act of design as inseparable from enriching the self.",

The rigorous consideration of precedent and design research methods fosters a deeper connection of students' work with the discipline, better enabling them to position their ideas within a larger conceptual discourse while giving them the methodological tools to prepare them for the undertaking of a research and design thesis.",

The course is intended to provide students with an advanced knowledge base in contemporary architectural theory to ground more specialized graduate elective coursework while acting as a support for thesis and other forms of advanced architectural research.",

    "description": "The wide adoption of mobile technology presents a new opportunity. Leveraging this existing technology, healthcare systems can deliver remote care and collect real-time data on patients outside of health centres, minimizing unnecessary visits to hospitals and providing healthcare access to remote populations. In this course, we will explore how digital health technology has been designed, evaluated, and deployed in different countries. Case studies will be used to demonstrate how institutional and governmental constraints have a strong impact on the success of the deployment. The course will address the different digital health technologies in the market, such as Telehealth, remote patient monitoring, tele radiology, consumer health informatics, and mHealth. Important aspects of technology development like patient confidentiality, privacy, standards, communication and security protocols, regulatory requirements, among others, will be discussed when presenting the development of each digital health solution. By the end of this course, students will be prepared to design, evaluate, and deploy a digital health intervention and will have a solid understanding of the barriers and requirements for deploying digital health technology.",

Students will be exposed to contemporary trends and issues in evaluation theory, as well as methods and practice, while working with stakeholders. Course content covers evaluation planning, design and implementation. Attention will be given to theories of change, stakeholder engagement, evaluation approaches and methodologies. Discussions extend beyond basic evaluation to include interpretation and dissemination of findings, as well as evaluation management. The course uses real world problems across a range of applied health interests, and emphasizes experiential learning through a case- and team-based approach. This course is typically delivered in a one-week block held on the UW main campus, with additional online components.",

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course is intended to engage and advance knowledge and practice in Indigenous wellbeing and health through a social justice lens. The course critically links determinants of Indigenous Peoples¿ wellbeing and health to historical and ongoing colonial priorities and practices. Disparities in health and social issues, access to care, and systemic challenges, including racism experienced by Indigenous Peoples in different regions and contexts, are shared as points for discussion and reflection. An intersectionality lens is applied in consideration of the unique wellbeing and health experiences among Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous women, youth, and Two Spirit Peoples. Indigenous approaches to science, healing, and community-based ethical practices are also profiled in social work and health care delivery, research, policy, and programming. The knowledges, values, and perspectives of Indigenous Peoples are highlighted throughout this course, incorporated within a variety of resources including readings, film and other arts-based narratives that include Indigenous scholars and community activists, in the delivery of course content and assignments. This course was created in consultation with a local Indigenous Advisory Circle that included community-based Indigenous Elders, health leaders, social workers, and academics involved in Indigenous initiatives and research.

    "description": "The global cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus , sulfur, silicon and iron, are intimately linked to the chemical composition of the atmosphere and ocean, earth's climate, global biological productivity and diversity, and the evolution of sedimentary rocks.  This course focuses on the quantitative representation of the processes and mechanisms driving the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrient elements on both short (100-104 years) and long (>104 years) time scales.  Attention will also be given to the perturbation of biogeochemical cycles by human activity.  To explore the interactions between the processes, as well as between the elemental cycles themselves, we will use mass balance models.  Each student will carry out an independent project based on an elemental cycle of his/her choice.",

    "description": "Nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silica (Si) and carbon (C) are vital to organisms, and play an essential role in our everyday life.  Used in excess, they can also become a nuisance with unwanted effects on the environment.  This course focuses on nutrients from a hydrological perspective, using a river basin based viewpoint.  The course covers general nutrient cycles, then nutrient budgets in watersheds, and how to model nutrient fluxes in catchments, using different approaches.  We will also discuss pollution history, using nutrients and metal pollution in river basins over the last centuries.  This will enable students to understand challengers that might arise from a variety of issues, from pollution history to current practices.  Individual student projects will be based on either a particular element or a particular model.",

The focus will be on the coupling of biogeochemical reactions to transport processes in near-surface environments (ie., soils, sediments, tailings ponds, and shallow aquifer).  Examples will range from simple \"back of the envelope\" mass balance calculations to advanced numerical simulations.  Students will learn how to assemble the building blocks of a reactive transport model (RTM).  Particular attention will be given to the formulation of biogeochemical reaction networks, the kinetics of abiotic and biotic redox processes, mixed kinetic-equilibrium models, parameter calibration, numerical errors and simulation scenarios.  Some advanced topics, such as bioenergetics controls, genome-enabled RTMs and dual-porosity media will be covered as special topics.",

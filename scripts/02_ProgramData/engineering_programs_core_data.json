Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n2. Biomedical Systems\n3. Human Factors\n4. Mechatronics and Physical Systems\n5. Vision, Image and Signal Processing\nA Graduate Specialization is a University credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript but not on the diploma and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed a set of courses that together provide an in-depth study in the area of the Graduate Specialization. A student will only obtain the Graduate Specialization on their transcript if they have completed the requirements associated with the MEng degree and the requirements associated with the Graduate Specialization.\nAll MEng Graduate Specializations in Systems Design Engineering consist of a set of 4 graduate (0.50 weight) level courses and this set is comprised of a mix of specified and elective courses. Specified courses are those that are prescribed as part of the Graduate Specialization. Elective courses are those that are on a list of courses designated as electives for a given Graduate Specialization. The requirements for each of the five Graduate Specializations are described below.\n1. Graduate Specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nStudents must satisfy the following:\n3 Specified courses:\nSYDE 522 Machine Intelligence or SYDE 552 Computational​​​​ Neurosciences\nSYDE 660A Systems Design Graduate Workshop 1 – AI and Machine Learning\nSYDE 675 Pattern Recognition\nElective courses (at least 1 course from the following list):\nSYDE 662 Systems Design Graduate Workshop 2\nSYDE 671 Advanced Image Processing\nSYDE 672 Statistical Image Processing\nSYDE 673 Video Processing & Analytics\nSYDE 674 3D Computer Vision & Imaging\n2. Graduate Specialization in Biomedical Systems\nStudents must satisfy the following:\n3 Specified courses:\nSYDE 660B Systems Design Graduate Workshop 1 – Biomedical Systems\nAt least 2 from the following list:\nSYDE 544 Biomed Measure & SIP\nSYDE 684 Materials Biocompatability\nSYDE 750 Topic 20 Topics in Systems Modelling: Modeling of​​​​​​​ Biomechanical Systems\nSYDE 750 Topic 36 Topics in Systems Modelling: Assistive​​​​​​​ Tech and Rehab Eng\nElective courses (at least 1 from the following list or an additional course from the Specified course list)\nSYDE 552 Computational Neurosciences​​​​​​​\nSYDE 556 Simulating Neurobiological Systems\nSYDE 652 Dynamics of Multibody Systems\nSYDE 662 Systems Design Graduate Workshop 2\nSYDE 677 Medical Imaging\nNote that only one 500 level course may be used to satisfy the requirements of a Graduate Specialization. Therefore, if​​​​​ SYDE 544 is taken as a Specified course, then SYDE 552 and SYDE 556 cannot be taken to satisfy the Elective course requirement.\n3. Graduate Specialization in Human Factors\nStudents must satisfy the following:\n3 Specified courses:\nSYDE 660C Systems Design Graduate Workshop 1 – Human Factors\nAt least 2 from the following list:\nSYDE 542 Interface Design or SYDE 543 Cognitive Ergonomics\nSYDE 642 Cognitive Engineering Methods\nSYDE 644 Human Factors Testing\nElective courses (at least 1 from the following list or an additional course from the Specified course list):\nSYDE 533 Conflict Resolution\nSYDE 662 Systems Design Graduate Workshop 2\nSYDE 740 Advanced Cognitive Ergonomics\nNote that only one 500 level course may be used to satisfy the requirements of a Graduate Specialization.

Graduate Specialization in Mechatronic and Physical Systems\nStudents must satisfy the following:\n3 Specified courses:\nSYDE 660D Systems Design Graduate Workshop 1 - Mechatronic & Physical Systems\nAt least 2 from the following list:\nSYDE 553 Advanced Dynamics\nSYDE 652 Dynamics of Multibody Systems\nSYDE 655 Optimal Control\nSYDE 682 Advanced MEMS, Physics, Design & Fabrication\nSYDE 683 Modelling, Simulation & Design of MEMS​​​​​​​\nSYDE 750 Modelling Continuum Systems\nElective courses (at least 1 from the following list or an additional course from the Specified course list):\nSYDE 531 Design Opt. under Probabilistic Uncertainty\nSYDE 631 Time Series Modelling\nSYDE 661 Model-based robust design\nSYDE 662 Systems Design Graduate Workshop 2\nNote that only one 500 level course may be used to satisfy the requirements of a Graduate Specialization. Therefore, if​​​​​​​ SYDE 553 is taken as a Specified course, then SYDE 531 cannot be taken to satisfy the Elective course requirement.\n5. Graduate Specialization in Vision, Image and Signal Processing\nStudents must satisfy the following:\n3 Specified courses:\nSYDE 660E Systems Design Graduate Workshop 1 - Vision, Image & Signal Processing\nAt least 2 from the following list:\nSYDE 575 Image Processing\nSYDE 671 Advanced Image Processing\nSYDE 677 Medical Imaging\nElective courses (at least 1 from the following list or an additional course from the Specified course list):\nSYDE 544 Biomed Measure & SIP\nSYDE 633 Remote Sensing Systems\nSYDE 662 Systems Design Graduate Workshop 2\nSYDE 672 Statistical Image Processing\nSYDE 673 Video Processing & Analytics​​​​​​​\nSYDE 674 3D Computer Vision & Imaging\nSYDE 675 Pattern Recognition\nNote that only one 500 level course may be used to satisfy the requirements of a Graduate Specialization. Therefore, if​​​​​​​ SYDE 575 is taken as a specified course, then SYDE 544 cannot be taken to satisfy the Elective course requirement.\nAll course selections are arranged by the student.\nNote: these requirements are in addition to satisfactory completion of any transitional courses that may be specified at the time of admission."

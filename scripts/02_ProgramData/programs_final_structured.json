Course work may, however, include prerequisites to the required courses, particularly if the student has been admitted with an Honours Bachelor's degree. No student who requires more than two terms of prerequisite course work will be admitted to the program. It is expected that, after completion of any prerequisite course work, the student will complete the course requirements and write the comprehensive examination within two years, and complete the thesis within four years of admission.\nThe University Senate has set the following time limits for a PhD program:\nfrom an Honours Bachelor's degree: 18 terms (6 years)\nfrom a Master's degree: 12 terms (4 years)\nGraduate research fields\nEmpirical/Archival Research in Accounting\nJudgement and Decision-Making\nAdmission requirements: Minimum requirements\nSuccessful completion of a Master's degree or Honour's Bachelor's degree with at least an 80% average.\nStudents from various backgrounds, including economics, psychology and other academic disciplines are encouraged to apply.

This will require specialization in the following ways:\nSelection of an appropriate core discipline from economics, psychology, or another academic discipline other than accounting to provide the foundation for the chosen subject area and methods specialty.\nSelection of one subject area chosen from: accounting information systems, auditing, financial accounting, management accounting, or taxation.\nSelection of one methods specialty from archival, analytical, experimental, or field.\nWhile specialization is essential for students to be able to conduct research, breadth is also important for an accounting academic career. Students are expected to be familiar with the various research questions and methods used outside of their selected specialty area.\nCourse requirements\nStudents will select appropriate coursework for their chosen core discipline, subject area and methods specialty. Course selections shall be approved each term, in advance, by the Graduate Officer. The specific requirements are as follows:\nStudents must complete 12 graduate level courses (0.50 unit weight) as follows:\nCore discipline: at least 2 graduate-level courses from economics, psychology, or another academic discipline other than accounting to provide the appropriate foundation for the chosen subject area and methods specialty.\nSubject area:\nACC 781 Introduction to Accounting Research: will be offered to all PhD students in their first year and will introduce them to important research questions and methods in accounting. This course will stress issues of research design.\nACC 782 Experimental & Field Research in Accounting, and ACC 783 Archival & Analytic Research in Accounting will be offered in alternating Winter terms to first- and second-year students. These courses will introduce research methods used in accounting research.\nAt least 2 other accounting PhD seminar courses.\nMethods specialty: at least 2 graduate-level courses chosen from statistics, econometrics, psychometrics, research design or other related areas of study.\nIn addition to formal coursework, students are expected to attend the School's research workshops since an early orientation to research is critical for success in the program.\nThe PhD Policy Committee may modify or extend course requirements where it deems the student's background and research interests warrants it. At the discretion of the Committee, additional courses beyond the minimum PhD requirements may be required of individual students. The Committee may also substitute 2 senior undergraduate courses if appropriate graduate-level courses are unavailable.\nThe PhD Policy Committee will assign each student a faculty advisor who will assist the Graduate Officer in approving appropriate course work and ensure an early orientation to research. The faculty advisor and Graduate Officer will jointly approve the student's choice of specialization, which must be identified by the end of the first spring term of study. At this time, the PhD Policy Committee will review the student's program and appoint a new faculty advisor, if necessary.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Research Paper\nStudents are required to complete a PhD Research Paper in the first spring term. Normally, the student’s faculty advisor will serve as the faculty supervisor (or co-supervisor) for the research paper. The Graduate Officer will consult with the student to identify a potential faculty supervisor (or co-supervisors) as necessary.\nPhD Internship\nEach PhD student must complete a minimum of 6 terms of research internship with faculty members from the School of Accounting and Finance. Normally, at least two of the internships will be supervised by the student’s faculty advisor.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the Faculty of Arts Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements with the exception that in the Faculty of Arts, the Graduate Chair can approve the committee for comprehensive examinations.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Accounting program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nUpon satisfactory completion of course work (no failures, 78% average) students will write a comprehensive examination measuring knowledge in the chosen core discipline, subject area and methods specialty. The written examination component of the comprehensive examination will have two requirements:\nSpecialist - to measure whether the student has the necessary foundation, methodological knowledge and skills to conduct research in the chosen methods specialty.\nBreadth - to measure understanding of the various research questions and methods used in accounting research. A specialist level of knowledge will not be expected in research issues outside the student's selected core discipline, subject area and methods specialty.\nPhD Thesis\nAt the end of the first spring term of study, the Graduate Officer will consult with the student to identify a potential supervisor (or co-supervisors). The supervisor (or one of the co-supervisors) must be a tenure stream faculty member from the School of Accounting and Finance with Sole-Supervisory Privilege Status (SSPS2).\nWithin one month of successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the student and the supervisor (or co-supervisors) will jointly decide the composition of the student’s advisory committee. Normally, the members of the advisory committee will be the supervisor (or co-supervisors) and two other faculty members from the School of Accounting and Finance. The student will communicate to the Graduate Officer the composition of their advisory committee.\nThe student will submit a proposal for the PhD thesis containing a detailed statement and justification of a research problem and method and a review of relevant literature. An acceptable proposal will demonstrate that the candidate has developed a research plan that should lead to an acceptable thesis and that the candidate has a clear understanding of the problem addressed, the relevant literature, and the research method. Normally the proposal should be a description of planned work rather than a work in progress. The proposal will be presented at a research seminar in the School of Accounting and Finance.\nThe completed thesis will be defended in an oral examination conducted in accordance with the general requirements of the University.\nNormally, the examining committee will consist of the supervisor, two other faculty members from the School of Accounting and Finance, an internal-external member, and an external examiner.\nOther requirements\nFormal evaluations of student progress will be conducted by the Graduate Officer in consultation with the student’s faculty advisor or supervisor. Students whose progress does not meet the program's standards will be required to withdraw.\nLanguage requirements: no language requirements, other than English, are specified.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Accounting and Finance website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Accounting future students program page\nfile_upload",

This should be provided by successful completion of a Master’s thesis in a mathematics-related discipline.\nIn some circumstances a student enrolled in the MMath program (thesis) in Applied Mathematics may transfer to the PhD program without completing their MMath program.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nRésumé\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: normally from academic sources.\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nNote: The program of studies of a PhD student is directed by a PhD Advisory Committee consisting of the supervisor(s) and two other faculty members. This committee should be approved (by the graduate officer) within three terms of enrollment. At least one of the two other members should be from (or cross-appointed to) the Department, and one of the members should be from outside the research group of the supervisor(s).\nCourse requirements\nStudents must complete 4 one-term (0.50 unit) graduate courses after the Master's degree, at least one of which must be an AMATH course, or 8 one-term (0.50 unit) graduate courses after the Bachelor's degree, at least three of which must be AMATH courses. Candidates for the PhD degree must maintain a grade point average of at least 70% in their coursework.\nStudents may not count more than 2 graduate courses that are cross-listed/held with undergraduate courses for credit towards their PhD degree. This restriction applies to all 600-level AMATH courses and any cross-listed/held with courses offered by other departments. Note: students who transfer directly into the PhD program (without completing the Master's degree) may take up to 4 graduate courses that are cross-listed/held with undergraduate courses.\nIf a PhD student has taken an equivalent course during a Master's program, this can be counted (upon approval from the Graduate Officer) towards completion of the breadth requirement but does not reduce the number of courses required.\nCourses are selected in consultation with the student's supervisor. Students are encouraged to select courses that will help them develop a broad knowledge of Mathematics and its applications: appropriate courses are often offered by other departments in the Faculties of Mathematics, Science and Engineering.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Applied Mathematics program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nDuring the third term of enrollment, the candidate will give a 30-minute pre-comprehensive seminar on the proposed research area, emphasizing background material. Shortly thereafter the advisory committee shall decide on the background topics that will comprise the candidate's comprehensive exam. The student will be informed of the areas of examination 3-4 months prior to the comprehensive examination.\nThe comprehensive examination is to be completed by the end of the student’s fifth term. The candidate will prepare a written research proposal (approximately 25 pages) that will be submitted to the members of the advisory committee and the examination chair (normally the graduate officer) at least two weeks prior to the comprehensive examination. The proposal should describe the research problem, together with motivation, literature review, an indication of methodology, any progress made to date, and a research plan with timeline.\nShortly before the comprehensive examination, the examination chair (through the graduate coordinator) will consult with the advisory committee to determine whether the committee wishes the exam to proceed and, if so, whether the committee wishes to meet to discuss the questions to be asked on background material. Each committee member will provide a typeset list of questions to the graduate coordinator four business days before the exam (about 3-5 questions, which can all be answered at a whiteboard in about 15 minutes). This list of questions will be provided to the candidate one hour prior to the start of the exam. The candidate will use this time to prepare answers, with no access to outside materials.\nThe examination will consist of a 20 minute presentation of the proposed research followed by two rounds of questions: the first on the prepared background questions, the second on the research proposal and the relevant literature. Each examiner shall question the candidate for approximately 15 minutes in each round. If there is more than one supervisor, they will share the allotted 15 minute time-slot. The comprehensive examination should normally be completed in two hours, after which the committee will consider the student’s progress to date, the proposal, and the student’s performance in the exam. Students who have not satisfactorily completed the comprehensive examination by the end of the fifth term will have their progress reviewed by the Departmental Graduate Chair.\nPhD Lecturing Requirement\nThis requirement is normally met by teaching a one-term undergraduate course, usually at the first or second year level, under the supervision of a faculty member. Students will satisfy this requirement after completing the comprehensive examination and after obtaining experience as a teaching assistant. If the department is unable to provide the student with a suitable undergraduate course to teach, the requirement may be met by giving a series of lectures of an introductory nature concerning the student's field of research.\nPhD Thesis\nA PhD thesis contains original results that warrant publication in the research literature. Indeed, candidates are encouraged to publish papers based on their research before submitting their theses. Moreover, the Department expects a PhD thesis to be a scholarly work that is broad in scope. As such, it should contain a discussion of the history of the research problem and an analysis of the relevant literature. For University guidelines on co-authored material in PhD theses please visit the\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs website\n; additional\ndepartmental guidelines\napply.\nThe candidate shall defend the thesis in an oral examination before an Examining Committee, which shall consist of the Advisory Committee, one faculty member from outside the Department, and an external examiner familiar with the student's research field.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Applied Mathematics future students program page\nfile_upload",

Students are encouraged to select courses that will help them develop a broad knowledge of Mathematics and its applications.\nThis degree is offered through the Collaborative Aeronautics Program. This program, jointly offered by a range of departments/schools across several academic faculties, promotes the development of interdisciplinary perspectives on aeronautics. Collaborative Aeronautics Program students complete their specialist training in their respective home departments/schools, while working with colleagues from a variety of other departments/schools in core interdisciplinary courses (AVIA 601 and AVIA 602/802).\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Applied Mathematics program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nDuring the third term of enrollment, the candidate will give a 30-minute pre-comprehensive seminar on the proposed research area, emphasizing background material. Shortly thereafter the advisory committee shall decide on the background topics that will comprise the candidate's comprehensive exam. The student will be informed of the areas of examination 3-4 months prior to the comprehensive examination.\nThe comprehensive examination is to be completed by the end of the student’s fifth term. The candidate will prepare a written research proposal (approximately 25 pages) that will be submitted to the members of the advisory committee and the examination chair (normally the graduate officer) at least two weeks prior to the comprehensive examination. The proposal should describe the research problem, together with motivation, literature review, an indication of methodology, any progress made to date, and a research plan with timeline.\nShortly before the comprehensive examination, the examination chair (through the graduate coordinator) will consult with the advisory committee to determine whether the committee wishes the exam to proceed and, if so, whether the committee wishes to meet to discuss the questions to be asked on background material. Each committee member will provide a typeset list of questions to the graduate coordinator four business days before the exam (about 3-5 questions, which can all be answered at a whiteboard in about 15 minutes). This list of questions will be provided to the candidate one hour prior to the start of the exam. The candidate will use this time to prepare answers, with no access to outside materials.\nThe examination will consist of a 20 minute presentation of the proposed research followed by two rounds of questions: the first on the prepared background questions, the second on the research proposal and the relevant literature. Each examiner shall question the candidate for approximately 15 minutes in each round. If there is more than one supervisor, they will share the allotted 15 minute time-slot. The comprehensive examination should normally be completed in two hours, after which the committee will consider the student’s progress to date, the proposal, and the student’s performance in the exam. Students who have not satisfactorily completed the comprehensive examination by the end of the fifth term will have their progress reviewed by the Departmental Graduate Chair.\nPhD Lecturing Requirement\nThis requirement is normally met by teaching a one-term undergraduate course, usually at the first or second year level, under the supervision of a faculty member. Students will satisfy this requirement after completing the comprehensive examination and after obtaining experience as a teaching assistant. If the department is unable to provide the student with a suitable undergraduate course to teach, the requirement may be met by giving a series of lectures of an introductory nature concerning the student's field of research.\nPhD Thesis\nThe thesis should have a substantial focus on Applied Mathematics and Aeronautics. A PhD thesis contains original results that warrant publication in the research literature. Indeed, candidates are encouraged to publish papers based on their research before submitting their theses. Moreover, the Department expects a PhD thesis to be a scholarly work that is broad in scope. As such, it should contain a discussion of the history of the research problem and an analysis of the relevant literature. For University guidelines on co-authored material in PhD theses please visit the\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs website\n; additional\ndepartmental guidelines\napply.\nThe candidate shall defend the thesis in an oral examination before an Examining Committee, which shall consist of the Advisory Committee, one faculty member from outside the Department, and an external examiner familiar with the student's research field.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Applied Mathematics - Aeronautics future students program page\nfile_upload",

Students are encouraged to select courses that will help them develop a broad knowledge of Mathematics and its applications: appropriate courses are often offered by other departments in the Faculties of Mathematics, Science and Engineering.\nMilestone requirements\nCollaborative Research Seminar I\nStudents are required to present a seminar on their thesis or major paper research proposal and, if appropriate, early stage results to current and past Water students and Water Institute faculty members. Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nCollaborative Research Seminar II\nStudents who have completed the Collaborative Research Seminar 1 as part of their Masters Water degree, must complete the Collaborative Research Seminar 2.\nStudents are required to present a seminar on their PhD thesis proposal to current and past water students and Water Institute faculty members. Seminars will normally occur following the completion of required courses and the comprehensive exam. Seminars should present how learnings from the Collaborative Water Program were applied in, or influenced, thesis proposals. Seminars will normally be poster presentations or talks at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis proposal; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nCollaborative Academic Contribution\nStudents who have completed the Collaborative Water Program Research Seminar 1 as part of their Masters Water degree, must complete the Collaborative Academic Contribution milestone.\nStudents are required to make an academic contribution to the Collaborative Water Program. The proposed contribution will be documented by the student and approved by the student’s Supervisor and the Collaborative Water Program Director. Potential contributions may include, but not be limited to:\nDevelopment of new or improved curricula or course content;\nDelivery of a lecture(s);\nPreparation of a publication;\nPreparation of a case study;\nMentorship of a group of students.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Applied Mathematics - Water program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nDuring the third term of enrollment, the candidate will give a 30-minute pre-comprehensive seminar on the proposed research area, emphasizing background material. Shortly thereafter the advisory committee shall decide on the background topics that will comprise the candidate's comprehensive exam. The student will be informed of the areas of examination 3-4 months prior to the comprehensive examination.\nThe comprehensive examination is to be completed by the end of the student’s fifth term. The candidate will prepare a written research proposal (approximately 25 pages) that will be submitted to the members of the advisory committee and the examination chair (normally the graduate officer) at least two weeks prior to the comprehensive examination. The proposal should describe the research problem, together with motivation, literature review, an indication of methodology, any progress made to date, and a research plan with timeline.\nShortly before the comprehensive examination, the examination chair (through the graduate coordinator) will consult with the advisory committee to determine whether the committee wishes the exam to proceed and, if so, whether the committee wishes to meet to discuss the questions to be asked on background material. Each committee member will provide a typeset list of questions to the graduate coordinator four business days before the exam (about 3-5 questions, which can all be answered at a whiteboard in about 15 minutes). This list of questions will be provided to the candidate one hour prior to the start of the exam. The candidate will use this time to prepare answers, with no access to outside materials.\nThe examination will consist of a 20 minute presentation of the proposed research followed by two rounds of questions: the first on the prepared background questions, the second on the research proposal and the relevant literature. Each examiner shall question the candidate for approximately 15 minutes in each round. If there is more than one supervisor, they will share the allotted 15 minute time-slot. The comprehensive examination should normally be completed in two hours, after which the committee will consider the student’s progress to date, the proposal, and the student’s performance in the exam. Students who have not satisfactorily completed the comprehensive examination by the end of the fifth term will have their progress reviewed by the Departmental Graduate Chair.\nPhD Lecturing Requirement\nThis requirement is normally met by teaching a one-term undergraduate course, usually at the first or second year level, under the supervision of a faculty member. Students will satisfy this requirement after completing the comprehensive examination and after obtaining experience as a teaching assistant. If the department is unable to provide the student with a suitable undergraduate course to teach, the requirement may be met by giving a series of lectures of an introductory nature concerning the student's field of research.\nPhD Thesis\nThe program of study should have a substantial focus on water. A PhD thesis contains original results that warrant publication in the research literature. Indeed, candidates are encouraged to publish papers based on their research before submitting their theses. Moreover, the Department expects a PhD thesis to be a scholarly work that is broad in scope. As such, it should contain a discussion of the history of the research problem and an analysis of the relevant literature. For University guidelines on co-authored material in PhD theses please visit the\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs website\n; additional\ndepartmental guidelines\napply.\nThe candidate shall defend the thesis in an oral examination before an Examining Committee, which shall consist of the Advisory Committee, one faculty member from outside the Department, and an external examiner familiar with the student's research field.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Applied Mathematics - Water future students program page\nfile_upload",

The thesis should be provided to the examining committee at least two weeks before the defence date.\nOther requirements\nDirect transfer into the PhD program: A Master's student with an excellent record and strong progress in research may apply for direct transfer into the PhD program after one year of Master's studies. To initiate this process, the student's supervisor must submit a written request to the Graduate Officer. Names of two potential examiners should be included. The request should be accompanied by a statement of research progress to date, written by the student, approximately three pages in length. If the student's record is deemed to be of sufficient standing, the statement of research progress will be forwarded to the examining committee, and the student will be invited to present this summary at a 40 minute presentation followed by questioning by the examining committee. This examination normally takes place in the student's fourth term. If successful, the student is transferred directly into the PhD program and this examination then retroactively takes the place of the pre-comprehensive seminar, which is used by the student's committee to determine the topics for the comprehensive exam; that exam should take place in the student's fifth term.\nMaster's Research Paper option: Course requirements\nStudents must complete 7 one-term (0.50 unit) graduate courses, at least 4 of which must be AMATH courses.

The MMath thesis is a comprehensive study that contributes to the understanding of a research topic, either by relating various approaches in the literature or by developing new methods. An MMath thesis is not required to contain original results. However, it is not uncommon for students - particularly those who have had research experience as undergraduates - to obtain new results that lead to publication in the research literature. For University guidelines on co-authored material in Masters theses please visit the\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs website\n; additional\ndepartmental guidelines\napply.\nThe Master's thesis is read by a committee that consists of the thesis supervisor and two other faculty members who are knowledgeable about the research area. The supervisor and at least one of the other two committee members must be affiliated with the Department of Applied Mathematics.\nThe student will present their results in a thesis defence, which consists of a 20 minute presentation by the candidate, followed by detailed questioning by the committee members. The thesis should be provided to the examining committee at least two weeks before the defence date.\nOther requirements\nDirect transfer into the PhD program: A Master's student with an excellent record and strong progress in research may apply for direct transfer into the PhD program after one year of Master's studies. To initiate this process, the student's supervisor must submit a written request to the Graduate Officer. Names of two potential examiners should be included. The request should be accompanied by a statement of research progress to date, written by the student, approximately three pages in length. If the student's record is deemed to be of sufficient standing, the statement of research progress will be forwarded to the examining committee, and the student will be invited to present this summary at a 40 minute presentation followed by questioning by the examining committee. This examination normally takes place in the student's fourth term. If successful, the student is transferred directly into the PhD program and this examination then retroactively takes the place of the pre-comprehensive seminar, which is used by the student's committee to determine the topics for the comprehensive exam; that exam should take place in the student's fifth term.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics website\nMaster of Mathematics (MMath) in Applied Mathematics - Aeronautics future students program page\nfile_upload",

Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nMaster's Thesis\nThe program of study should have a substantial focus on water. The MMath thesis is a comprehensive study that contributes to the understanding of a research topic, either by relating various approaches in the literature or by developing new methods. An MMath thesis is not required to contain original results. However, it is not uncommon for students - particularly those who have had research experience as undergraduates - to obtain new results that lead to publication in the research literature. For University guidelines on co-authored material in Masters theses please visit the\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs website\n; additional\ndepartmental guidelines\napply.\nThe Master's thesis is read by a committee that consists of the thesis supervisor and two other faculty members who are knowledgeable about the research area. The supervisor and at least one of the other two committee members must be affiliated with the Department of Applied Mathematics.\nThe student will present their results in a thesis defence, which consists of a 20 minute presentation by the candidate, followed by detailed questioning by the committee members. The thesis should be provided to the examining committee at least two weeks before the defence date.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics website\nMaster of Mathematics (MMath) in Applied Mathematics - Water future students program page\nfile_upload",

by the supervisor(s) in consultation with the student and is subject to the approval of the Director of the BME Graduate Program. Candidates may also be required to take additional courses as a result of a comprehensive examination. Students pursuing one of the program’s Graduate Research Fields should inform their supervisor(s) of their chosen field(s) to ensure appropriate course selection.\nThe Faculty of Engineering requires that no more than one-half of the courses used for credit towards a graduate degree may be taught by the candidate’s supervisor(s). In the case of co-supervision in small research groups, it may be necessary to relax this rule, but the student’s file must contain a statement of formal approval from the BME graduate program director and endorsement from the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs in the Faculty of Engineering.\nMilestone requirements\nProfessional Attributes and Competence Enhancement (PACE) Module\nThe PACE module milestone includes the following three components: Seminar series, PACE days, and Annual BME research day. The requirements for the three components are outlined below:\nSeminar series including presenting a research seminar:\nBiweekly seminar series with students and internal and external BME speakers (1.5-hour duration). Guest speakers will also be invited to speak at the seminar series. The topics may be related to BME research, academic integrity, or professional development.\nEach student must attend a minimum of five seminars per term, except for their final term. It is the student’s responsibility to submit their “Seminar Attendance Certificates” attached to their term activity report. BME records should show that the number of seminars a student has attended is at least four times the number of terms the student has been enrolled as a full-time student in the program.\nEach student will be required to present a research seminar by the end of their final term and as part of the PACE module milestones. BME will contact seminar candidates with scheduling information after they have passed their comprehensive exam (Parts I and II).\nPACE days:\nStudents are required to attend and participate in 2 PACE days at the beginning of terms 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. PACE days are dedicated to students’ professional development and the topics vary each term.\nAnnual BME Research Day – once per year\nStudents are required to attend and present at the Annual BME Research Day. The annual event gives students an opportunity to showcase their progress and research findings while building community among BME graduate students. Students are required to submit an abstract and give either an oral or poster presentation.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I and Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements outlined in the “Minimum requirements for the PhD degree” section of the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar (GSAC), with certain noted differences that are specific to the\nFaculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements\n:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering completion timelines.\nCommittee: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering committee composition guidelines which differ from the University-level minimum requirements in both number of committee members and committee makeup.\nWho Chairs an examination: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering Chair guidelines whereby the Chair is normally selected from outside of the student’s home department.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements but with additional information provided in the Faculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, PhD students in the Biomedical Engineering graduate program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nStudents must successfully complete (pass) the Comprehensive Background Examination (Comprehensive Exam I (Background)) and the Comprehensive Proposal Examination (Comprehensive Exam II (Proposal) which are conducted by the Department for each candidate.\nThe first exam, the Comprehensive Background Examination, will be held before the end of the third term (fourth term if transferring from an incomplete MASc). The main objective of this examination is to satisfy the Department that the candidate has a broad knowledge of their field and a thorough technical background to pursue their research; the candidate will be questioned on their background preparation.\nThe second exam, the Comprehensive Proposal Examination, will be held no later than the student’s sixth term and only after the Background Comprehensive Examination has been successfully completed. The main objective of this examination is to examine and approve the written thesis proposal.\nThe result of these examinations is the identification of an Advisory Committee which has examined and approved the candidate's background and thesis proposal and is willing to assist the supervisor with the subsequent research program.\nStudents who do not complete either Comprehensive Examination by the stated deadline, or fail either exam on their second attempt, will be required to withdraw from the program.\nIt is the supervisor’s responsibility to assemble the advisory committee.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents may choose to pursue one (1) of the following Graduate Research Fields:\nBiomaterials, Tissue Engineering, and Drug Delivery\nBiomechanics and Rehabilitation\nBiomedical Signals and Devices\nBiomedical Imaging Technology\nBiomedical Informatics\nCandidates are expected to attend annual meetings with their Advisory Committee and complete term reports to provide updates on their progress.\nA Graduate Research Field is a university credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed research concentrated in the area of the Graduate Research Field. The BME graduate program, represented by the student’s supervisor and examining committee, must assess whether a student’s completed research warrants the field designation at the time of degree completion.\nCandidates are expected to maintain continuous registration until the thesis is submitted to Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Under exceptional circumstances, inactive terms or a leave of absence may be requested for a prior specified period with program approval. The role of a supervisor is to assist a candidate in establishing a research problem with an appropriate scope, to suggest alternative general approaches to the solution of a problem and to provide general advice on the structure and content of a thesis. It is imperative that the engineering code of ethics be strictly observed in the supervisor-candidate relationship.\nThe PhD degree in the Faculty of Engineering is awarded to a candidate who has successfully completed a program of advanced study and conducted original research. The program of research and its findings must be presented in the form of a thesis and submitted to the University for public examination prior to its oral defense.\nThe writer of a thesis must demonstrate a critical awareness and understanding of the literature in the research field, exhibit a capability of defining original and useful research problems and a capability of independent thought in solving a research problem. An ability to communicate research results verbally and in writing must be shown. The University of Waterloo allows students to submit theses in English or in French, the latter being governed by certain important constraints. The principles governing the submission of theses in French are specified in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. The oral examination of a thesis will assess the ability of a candidate to communicate orally the results of the research and to defend the contents of the thesis.\nOriginality in a thesis may be reflected in a number of ways. A candidate may have posed and solved an important new problem or have formulated an existing problem in a novel and useful way. A candidate may offer new and significant insights into problems examined previously by other researchers. Replications of previous investigations may be acceptable if, and only if, they incorporate [significantly new] elements in the design or execution of an experiment.\nObjective criteria describing what is meant by a significant contribution to knowledge are difficult to specify. One way of gauging a candidate's contribution is to consider the extent to which parts of the thesis might be published in peer-reviewed technical journals with an international stature or as a monograph by an acceptable publisher. The ultimate test of the acceptability of a thesis is the ability of a candidate to satisfy, through an oral examination, to a university-appointed committee of research specialists in the general field of study, that a significant research contribution has been made and communicated adequately.\nfile_upload",

the Faculty of Engineering.\nAll courses must be completed by the end of term 4.\nAll course selections are arranged by the supervisor(s) in consultation with the student and are subject to the approval of the Director or Associate Director, BME graduate program. Students pursuing one the program’s Graduate Research Fields, should inform their supervisor(s) of their chosen field(s) to ensure appropriate course selection.\nNote: these requirements are in addition to satisfactory completion of any transitional courses that may be specified at the time of admission.\nNote: The Faculty of Engineering requires that no more than one-half of the courses used for credit toward a graduate degree may be taught by a candidate’s supervisor(s). In the case of co-supervision in small research groups, it may be necessary to relax this rule; however, the student’s file must contain a statement of formal approval from the BME graduate program director and endorsement from the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs in the Faculty of Engineering.\nThesis option: Milestone requirements\nProfessional Attributes and Competence Enhancement (PACE) Module\nThe PACE module milestone includes the following three components: a Seminar series, PACE days, and Annual BME research day. The requirements for the three components are outlined below:\nSeminar series including presenting a research seminar:\nBiweekly seminar series with students and internal and external BME speakers (1.5-hour duration). Guest speakers will also be invited to speak at the seminar series. The topics may be related to BME research, academic integrity, or professional development.\nEach student must attend a minimum of five seminars per term, except for their final term. It is the student’s responsibility to submit their “Seminar Attendance Certificates” attached to their term activity report. BME records should show that the number of seminars a student has attended is at least four times the number of terms the student has been enrolled as a full-time student in the program.\nEach student will be required to present a research seminar by the end of their final term and as part of the PACE module milestones. BME will contact seminar candidates with scheduling information after they have passed their proposal.\nPACE Days:\nStudents are required to attend and participate in 2 PACE days at the beginning of terms 1, 2, and 3. PACE days are dedicated to students’ professional development and the topics vary each term.\nAnnual BME Research Day – once per year\nStudents are required to attend and present at the Annual BME Research Day. The annual event gives students an opportunity to showcase their progress and research findings while building community among BME graduate students. Students are required to submit an abstract and give either an oral or poster presentation.\nMaster’s Thesis Proposal\nStudents must develop and defend a thesis proposal that will be examined and approved by their supervisor and committee. The thesis proposal must be completed by the end of term 3.\nMaster’s Thesis\nStudents may choose to pursue one (1) of the following Graduate Research Fields:\nBiomaterials, Tissue Engineering, and Drug Delivery\nBiomechanics and Rehabilitation\nBiomedical Signals and Devices\nBiomedical Imaging Technology\nBiomedical Informatics\nA Graduate Research Field is a university credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed research concentrated in the area of the Graduate Research Field. The BME graduate program, represented by the student’s supervisor and examining committee, must assess whether a student’s completed research warrants the field designation at the time of degree completion.\nUpon approval of the thesis proposal, students will proceed to the research and writing of the thesis. Students must complete and orally defend the thesis by the end of term 6. The thesis and defence will be evaluated by the student’s Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee shall be comprised of: at least one tenured or tenure track faculty member from the BME graduate program who will normally be the student’s supervisor(s); an additional tenured or tenure track BME graduate faculty member; and at least one additional examiner who is not a BME faculty member (but may be from a department with BME faculty members) and whose expertise can support the evaluation of the Master’s thesis. Consistent with the Faculty of Engineering requirements, a maximum of one committee member with an adjunct appointment or emeritus status is permitted.\nfile_upload",

Degree requirements must be satisfied within four calendar years following the date of admission into the PhD program, unless extensions are approved by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research, Engineering. Requests for extension must be supported by a written departmental recommendation along with a realistic timetable for the completion of the degree and evidence of adequate progress in research. Extensions are not granted automatically and will be refused in the case of inadequate progress. University of Waterloo regulations stipulate that approval of an extension past three extended terms is at the discretion of the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies.\nA minimum of two terms of full-time residence is expected from students who wish to proceed on a part-time basis. Full-time residency means that a student is present on campus for at least three days a week, or a sufficient period of time per week to satisfy the supervisor. The most appropriate time for this residence period will be established in consultation with the supervisor(s) and the Associate Chair Graduate Studies.\nPart-time students should be advised that the Faculty of Engineering expects at least 20 hours per week to be devoted to advanced study and research.\nGraduate research fields\nBiotechnology and Biomedical Engineering\nElectrochemical Engineering\nNanotechnology for Advanced Materials\nProcess Systems Engineering\nSoft Matter and Polymer Engineering\nSustainable Reaction Engineering\nAdmission requirements: Minimum requirements\nAt the time of admission, each student must have an approved PhD supervisor who has agreed in writing to supervise their academic program or co-supervisors, at least one of whom is an approved PhD supervisor. The Faculty of Engineering maintains a list of individually approved research supervisors, known as Approved Doctoral Dissertation Supervisors (ADDS). Additions to and deletions from this list are made by the Engineering Graduate Studies Sub-Committee upon the recommendation of the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.\nApplicants must demonstrate excellence of background preparation and academic achievement in prior degrees and, usually, possess a relevant, thesis-based Master's degree. In the Faculty of Engineering, a minimum 80% standing in an applicant's appropriate Master's program is the usual requirement. A Master's degree obtained without a full research thesis is normally an inadequate qualification for admission to the PhD program.\nWithin the three required references for admission to Graduate Studies, the opinions on academic preparation and research ability must refer to the applicant’s demonstrated ability to formulate research problems and execute the research required to solve problems, as indicated by a Master’s of Applied Science (MASc) research thesis or published scientific/technical paper. The references should also refer to the applicant having adequate English language skills to pursue a doctoral program, with all of its requirements, at the University of Waterloo.\nThe Engineering Graduate Studies Sub-Committee requires objective evidence of English language skills. Technical publications that have been written principally by an applicant and published in refereed English language journals, a thesis written in English, or a personal interview with the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies are also considered as evidence.\nTransfer to the PhD program without completion of the MASc program: A student enrolled in a MASc program at the University of Waterloo may apply for transfer to the PhD program without completing a Master's degree. Transfer from a MASc program to a PhD program will normally be initiated at the Department level.\nThe supervisor shall prepare for the Chemical Engineering Department’s Graduate Review Committee a memorandum that summarizes the applicant’s qualifications for transfer. At least one additional written recommendation from another Chemical Engineering Department faculty member will facilitate a decision on the transfer request.\nAdmission to the PhD program from a BASc program: In exceptional cases, applicants who have spent at least three years pursuing an appropriate Honours Bachelor's degree may be considered for admission to a PhD program, upon request from the Chemical Engineering Department.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nRésumé\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: at least 2 academic\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nStudents with a Master’s degree in a discipline closely related to Chemical Engineering as deemed by the Associate Chair Graduate Studies, must complete 1.75 units meeting the following criteria:\nCHE 600 Engineering and Research Methods, Ethics, Practice, and Law (0.25 unit weight)\n3 graduate level elective courses at the 600 level or higher (0.5 unit weight).

Degree requirements must be satisfied within four calendar years following the date of admission into the PhD program, unless extensions are approved by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research, Engineering. Requests for extension must be supported by a written departmental recommendation along with a realistic timetable for the completion of the degree and evidence of adequate progress in research. Extensions are not granted automatically and will be refused in the case of inadequate progress. University of Waterloo regulations stipulate that approval of an extension past three extended terms is at the discretion of the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies.\nA minimum of two terms of full-time residence is expected from students who wish to proceed on a part-time basis. Full-time residency means that a candidate is present on campus for at least three days a week, or a sufficient period of time per week to satisfy the supervisor. The most appropriate time for this residence period will be established in consultation with the supervisor(s) and the Associate Chair Graduate Studies.\nPart-time students should be advised that the Faculty of Engineering expects at least 20 hours per week to be devoted to advanced study and research.\nAdmission requirements: Minimum requirements\nAt the time of admission, each student must have an approved PhD supervisor who has agreed in writing to supervise their academic program or co-supervisors, at least one of whom is an approved PhD supervisor. The Faculty of Engineering maintains a list of individually approved research supervisors, called Approved Doctoral Dissertation Supervisors (ADDS). Additions to and deletions from this list are made by the Engineering Graduate Studies Sub-Committee upon the recommendation of the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.\nApplicants must demonstrate excellence of background preparation and academic achievement in prior degrees and, usually, possess a relevant, thesis-based Master's degree. In the Faculty of Engineering, a minimum 80% standing in an applicant's appropriate Master's program is the usual requirement. A Master's degree obtained without a full research thesis is normally an inadequate qualification for admission to the PhD program.\nWithin the three required references for admission to Graduate Studies, the opinions on academic preparation and research ability must refer to the applicant’s demonstrated ability to formulate research problems and execute the research required to solve problems, as indicated by a Master’s of Applied Science (MASc) research thesis or published scientific/technical papers. The references should also refer to the applicant having adequate English language skills to pursue a doctoral program, with all of its requirements, at the University of Waterloo.\nThe Engineering Graduate Studies Sub-Committee requires objective evidence of English language skills. Technical publications that have been written principally by an applicant and published in refereed English language journals, and/or a thesis written in English, or a personal interview with the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies are also considered as evidence.\nTransfer to the PhD program without completion of the MASc program: A student enrolled in a MASc program at the University of Waterloo may apply for transfer to the PhD program without completing a Master's degree. Transfer from a MASc program to a PhD program will normally be initiated at the Department level. The supervisor shall prepare for the Department Graduate Review Committee a memorandum that summarizes the candidate's qualifications for transfer. At least one additional written recommendation from another Chemical Engineering Department faculty member will facilitate a decision on the transfer request.\nAdmission to the PhD program from a BASc program: In exceptional cases, applicants who have spent at least three years pursuing an appropriate bachelor’s degree may be considered for admission to a PhD program upon request from the Chemical Engineering Department.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nRésumé\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: at least 2 academic\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nStudents with a Master’s degree in a discipline closely related to Chemical Engineering as deemed by the Associate Chair Graduate Studies, must complete 1.75 units meeting the following criteria:\nCHE 600 Engineering and Research Methods, Ethics, Practice, and Law (0.25 unit weight)\nWATER 601 Integrated Water Management (0.5 unit weight)\nWATER 602 Integrated Water Management Project (0.5 unit weight)\n1 graduate level CHE elective course at the 600 level or higher (0.5 unit weight). Note that 1 500 level course may be substituted here if recommended by the student's supervisor, and approved by the Associate Chair, Graduate Studies and the Associate Dean, Graduate Studies.\nNo more than 1 may be taught by supervisor(s).\nNo more than 1 may be a reading course.\nStudents entering directly from their undergraduate degree must complete 3.75 units meeting following criteria:\nCHE 600 Engineering and Research Methods, Ethics, Practice, and Law (0.25 unit weight)\nWATER 601 Integrated Water Management (0.5 unit weight)\nWATER 602 Integrated Water Management Project (0.5 unit weight)\n5 graduate level elective courses (0.5 unit weight). Of these, 4 must be 600 level or higher and 1 can be 500 level or higher. At least 4 of these must be CHE courses. Note that 1 additional 500 level course may be substituted here if recommended by the student's supervisor, and approved by the Associate Chair, Graduate Studies and the Associate Dean, Graduate Studies.\nNo more than 2 may be taught by supervisor(s).\nNo more than 1 may be a reading course.\nStudents with a Master’s degree in a discipline outside of Chemical Engineering, as deemed by the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies, must complete 2.25 units meeting the following criteria:\nCHE 600 Engineering and Research Methods, Ethics, Practice, and Law (0.25 unit weight)\nWATER 601 Integrated Water Management (0.5 unit weight)\nWATER 602 Integrated Water Management Project (0.5 unit weight)\n2 graduate level elective courses at the 600 level or higher (0.5 unit weight). All of these must be CHE courses. Note that 1 500 level course may be substituted here if recommended by the student's supervisor, and approved by the Associate Chair, Graduate Studies and the Associate Dean, Graduate Studies.\nNo more than 1 may be taught by supervisor(s).\nNo more than 1 may be a reading course.\nThis degree is offered through the Collaborative Water Program. This program, jointly offered by a range of departments across several academic faculties, promotes the development of interdisciplinary perspectives on water. Collaborative Water Program students complete their specialist training in their respective home departments, while working with colleagues from a variety of other departments in core interdisciplinary courses (WATER 601 and WATER 602).\nStudents who have already completed WATER 601 and WATER 602 as part of their Masters Water degree, must complete the following course requirement:\n1 graduate level water course from outside the student’s home Faculty agreed to by the student’s Supervisor and the Collaborative Water Program Director.\nThe Chemical Engineering Department may require students to take more than the number of courses specified above. In every case, a graduate course program is established by the supervisor(s) in consultation with the student and, if deemed necessary, with the Associate Chair Graduate Studies of the Department. Students may also be required to take additional courses as a result of a comprehensive examination.\nGraduate courses offered by the Faculty of Engineering are numbered as 600 or 700 series courses and are assigned a unit weight of 0.50, which means that they are one-term courses as defined in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar.\nOnly courses taken within five years prior to the completion of the PhD degree may be counted for credit towards a degree, unless a request for revalidation is granted.\nStudents must achieve a:\nMinimum cumulative average of 70%.\nMinimum grade of 65% in each individual course.\nEach student is responsible for monitoring their own academic records and must immediately notify their Graduate Coordinator of any inadequate grade or average.\nThe Chemical Engineering Department will determine whether or not collaborative program courses can be used as electives. It is therefore possible that students will need to take additional courses in order to meet the specific requirements of this program.\nMilestone requirements\nSeminar Attendance\nOver the course of their degree program, all students must attend 24 seminars from departments and research institutions where Chemical Engineering faculty members have a membership.

The normal full load is at least two 0.50 unit weight courses per term while concurrently maintaining acceptable progress in the research project.\nGraduate courses offered by the Faculty of Engineering are numbered as 600 or 700 series courses and are assigned a unit weight of 0.50, which means that they are one-term courses as defined in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar.\nThe Faculty of Engineering requires that no more than one half of the courses used for credit towards a graduate degree may be taught by a student’s supervisor(s). In the case of co-supervision in small research groups, it may be necessary to relax this rule: in such cases, the student's file must contain a statement of formal approval from the Chemical Engineering Department and endorsement from the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research of Engineering.\nOnly courses taken within five years prior to the completion of the MASc degree may be counted for credit towards a degree, unless a request for revalidation is granted.\nStudents must achieve a:\nMinimum cumulative average of 70%.\nMinimum grade of 65% in each course.\nNote: Probationary students may have specific grade requirements, which will be specified in their admission letters.\nEach student is responsible for monitoring their own academic records and must immediately notify the Graduate Coordinator of any inadequate grade or average.\nThesis option: Milestone requirements\nSeminar Attendance\nOver the course of their degree program, all students must attend 12 seminars from departments and research institutions where Chemical Engineering faculty members have a membership.

At other approved seminars, students must complete an attendance form and get it signed by the seminar organizer. Full instructions are available on the\nDepartment website\n.\nMaster's Thesis\nEach student must submit a thesis that reports the results of original research and discusses the significance of the work. The thesis must be acceptable to the student’s supervisor(s) and two additional faculty readers. Any of the readers may request that the student complete an oral examination.\nThe topic and scope of a thesis are arranged by the student and their supervisor. A MASc thesis should define a substantial research problem, provide a comprehensive review of the literature in the research problem area, describe the theoretical, analytical and/or experimental solution, and provide a comprehensive set of conclusions and recommendations.\nEach student must prepare a thesis in accordance with the current guidelines issued by Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs and the Faculty of Engineering.\nThesis submission: The student must distribute copies of their thesis to the readers designated by the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies. The readers will include the supervisor(s) plus at least two other faculty members. They will acknowledge receipt of the thesis from the student by initialing a Department Certification of MASc Thesis Submission and Acceptance form. The student must also submit one copy of their completed MASc thesis, along with their initialed Department Certification of MASc Thesis Submission and Acceptance form, to the Engineering Graduate Studies Office. A representative of the office will confirm acceptance of the thesis by initialing the Department Certification of MASc Thesis Submission and Acceptance form and then email notice of the thesis deposit to the Chemical Engineering department. The thesis will be put on display in the Engineering Graduate Studies Office, and therefore made available to members of the University community, for three weeks. Once the student’s Department Certification of MASc Thesis Submission and Acceptance form has been signed by a representative of the Engineering Graduate Studies Office, the student must return the form to the Chemical Engineering Department’s Graduate Coordinator.\nThesis evaluation: Within three weeks of their receipt of the thesis, each reader will return the thesis with their comments to the student and, upon acceptance of the thesis, sign the student’s Department Certification of MASc Thesis Submission and Acceptance form. The student will return this form to the Chemical Engineering Department’s Graduate Coordinator. Once the student’s readers have accepted the thesis and the supervisor is satisfied that the student has completed all of the changes requested by the readers, the supervisor will sign the form to indicate their acceptance. The Chemical Engineering Department's Associate Chair of Graduate Studies will sign the form and forward it to the Engineering Graduate Studies Office. It will prepare a MASc Thesis Acceptance form and forward it to the student, the Chemical Engineering Department’s Graduate Studies Office and the University of Waterloo’s Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs.\nRestricted circulation of theses: Occasionally a research program may produce findings that warrant restrictions on the circulation of the thesis. This may result from constraints imposed by research sponsors or a belief that the work may produce patentable processes or devices. If the student and their supervisor(s) judge that some restrictions should be placed on a thesis, they should write to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies as early as possible in the research program, describing the nature of and reasons for these restrictions. If the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies concurs, then the approval of the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research of Engineering and the Associate Vice-President, Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs will be sought. The restriction is limited to one year, with a possible extension to a second year if an acceptable case can be made to the Associate Vice-President, Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs.\nCritical times: If their thesis is accepted on or before the last day of the term, a student is exempt from registering for the following term. Therefore, to avoid paying regular registration fees, the student should submit their thesis at least four weeks before the registration day of the following term. If the thesis requires major revisions that extend completion beyond the registration deadline, the student must register and pay fees for the pending term. Refunds may be made available under certain circumstances.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering website\nMaster of Applied Science (MASc) in Chemical Engineering future students program page\nfile_upload",

Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nMaster's Thesis\nEach student must submit a thesis that reports the results of original research and discusses the significance of the work. The thesis must be acceptable to the student’s supervisor(s) and two additional faculty readers. Any of the readers may request that the student complete an oral examination.\nThe topic and scope of a thesis are arranged by the student and their supervisor. A MASc thesis should define a substantial research problem, provide a comprehensive review of the literature in the research problem area, describe the theoretical, analytical and/or experimental solution, and provide a comprehensive set of conclusions and recommendations.\nEach student must prepare a thesis in accordance with the current guidelines issued by Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs and the Faculty of Engineering.\nThesis submission: The student must distribute copies of the thesis to the readers designated by the Chemical Engineering Department’s Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.

This may result from constraints imposed by research sponsors or a belief that the work may produce patentable processes or devices. If the student and their supervisor(s) judge that some restrictions should be placed on a thesis, they should write to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies as early as possible in the research program, describing the nature of and reasons for the restrictions.

Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nMaster's Thesis\nEach student must submit a thesis that reports the results of original research and discusses the significance of the work. The thesis must be acceptable to the student’s supervisor(s) and two additional faculty readers. Any of the readers may request that the student complete an oral examination.\nThe topic and scope of a thesis are arranged by the student and their supervisor. A MASc thesis should define a substantial research problem, provide a comprehensive review of the literature in the research problem area, describe the theoretical, analytical and/or experimental solution, and provide a comprehensive set of conclusions and recommendations.\nEach student must prepare a thesis in accordance with the current guidelines issued by Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs and the",

In exceptional cases, a graduate student enrolled in a MMath (Thesis) program in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization may, through the Graduate Officer and with the consent of the Supervisor, petition the Graduate Committee to be transferred into a PhD program. The guidelines for such a transfer are as follows:\nThe student has been enrolled in the MMath (Thesis) program for at least two terms.\nThe student has made considerable progress in the research project (of the type that would warrant the MMath degree) and is committed to carrying the project to completion in a PhD program.\nThe student gives a seminar presentation of the work carried out so far, and answers related questions to the satisfaction of an examining committee consisting of the supervisor and two other faculty members.\nStudents applying to the PhD program who hold a Master's degree from another university may, in some cases, be admitted initially into the MMath program. In such cases the Graduate Committee will decide, within three terms, whether to transfer the student into the PhD program.\nApplicants educated outside of Canada, including those from the United States, are recommended to submit scores from the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) subject test in mathematics. Neither the GRE general test nor the GRE subject test is required.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: normally from academic sources.\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nStudents must complete 8 courses, including the 2 Quantum Information core courses, and 3 other CO core courses. At least 5 of the courses taken should be CO courses and at least 4 should be QI courses (note that jointly offered or cross-listed courses, like CO681/QIC710, are regarded as both CO and QIC courses).

The lectures must additionally satisfy the following conditions:\nTwo faculty members must each attend at least two lectures with the same format.\nThe lectures must be at least 20 minutes in duration, and at least two of the lectures must be at least 45 minutes in duration.\nThe PhD Lecturing Requirement should normally be completed within the first eight terms of the student’s PhD program. Students may not put their thesis on display until at least the term following that in which the Lecturing Requirement was successfully completed.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nThis requirement consists of 2 written examinations covering the fundamentals of combinatorics and optimization. These are usually offered once a year, in the Spring term. The student must write one exam from two of the following three categories:\nCombinatorial Enumeration, Graph Theory\nContinuous Optimization, Discrete Optimization\nCryptography, Quantum Computing\nThe choice of exams is made by the student, in consultation with their supervisor. The exams must be taken within the first four terms of the student’s PhD program.\nThe PhD Comprehensive Examination requirement is satisfied by passing both examinations.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nThe PhD Thesis Proposal is an oral exam at which the student is expected to give a brief description of the questions they propose to work on for the PhD and a summary of the main results in this area. This exam should normally be taken within the first six terms of the student’s PhD program. The student should provide a short written version of their thesis proposal to their committee one week before the oral presentation. The PhD Thesis Proposal requirement is satisfied by successful completion of this exam.\nAdvisory Committee: each student has an Advisory Committee, which normally consists of the student's supervisor and two other department members with expertise in the area of the student's research interests. The Advisory Committee acts as the examining committee at the student's PhD Thesis Proposal, and is usually formed at this time. The members of the advisory committee will also usually act as examiners at the student's PhD defence. The Advisory Committee is selected by the Graduate Officer, who will consult the student and their supervisor.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must prepare a thesis in Quantum Information, embodying the results of original research, of a standard that would warrant publication in a research journal of the field. The thesis must be acceptable to the student's supervisor, to two professors in the Department and one professor outside the Department, and to an external examiner familiar with the student's research field. The student is required to defend the thesis at an oral examination.

The program involves an initial study period, a work period and a final study period. It is fairly flexible in length, each period comprising one or more terms. The usual pattern of study and work consists of two academic terms in which some or all of the courses are completed, a one or two-term work placement, and a final academic term in which the research paper, or coursework is completed. The student is encouraged to complete WIL 601 Career Foundations for Work-Integrated Learning in the term before the start of their work term. Admission to the co-op program is competitive. Students should apply for this option in their first term, and admittance will be decided based on the students first term marks.\nThe student will be required to do a one or two-term work placement at a suitable industrial location, to begin as soon as possible after the coursework, or 50% of the degree requirements have been completed. The student will also be expected to return to campus after the work placement in order to complete the research paper or remaining coursework. The student will be required to provide a work term report when they return to campus.",

A student meets the requirement by taking a number of advanced courses in a broad range of categories and areas. The courses used must all have a minimum mark of 78% (or equivalent).\nCategories and Areas for Breadth Requirement: the breadth requirement divides the subject matter of computer science into three broad categories. Each category is subdivided into areas that represent a range of the fields of computer science, as given in the table below. The table also indicates where computer science courses at the University of Waterloo fit in these categories and areas. A student must have at least 1 advanced course in six of the eleven areas, including at least one area from each category:\nCategory\nArea\nComputer Science (CS) courses\nComputing Technology\nSoftware Engineering\nCS 645, CS 646, CS 647, CS 745, CS 746, CS 846\nProgramming Languages\nCS 642, CS 644, CS 744, CS 747, CS 842\nHardware and Software Systems\nCS 650, CS 651, CS 652, CS 654, CS 655, CS 656, CS 657, CS 658, CS 755, CS 758, CS 854, CS 856, CS 858**,CS 869\nMathematics of Computing\nAlgorithms and Complexity\nCS 662, CS 664, CS 666, CS 758, CS 761, CS 762, CS 763, CS 764, CS 765, CS 767, CS 840, CS 858**, CS 860\nScientific and Symbolic Computing\nCS 670, CS 672, CS 675, CS 676, CS 679, CS 687, CS 770, CS 774, CS 775, CS 778, CS 779, CS 780, CS 794, CS 870, CS 887\nComputational Statistics\nCS 680, CS 685, CS 786, CS 794, CS 885\nQuantum Information and Computation\nCS 766, CS 768, CS 867\nApplications\nArtificial Intelligence\nCS 679, CS 684, CS 686, CS 784, CS 785, CS 787, CS 886\nDatabases\nCS 640, CS 648, CS 740, CS 741, CS 742, CS 743, CS 848, CS 856*\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nCS 649, CS 688, CS 781, CS 783, CS 788, CS 789, CS 791, CS 888, CS 889\nBioinformatics\nCS 682, CS 782, CS 882\nHealth Informatics\nCS 792\nNote: * The versions of CS 856 entitled \"Internet-Scale Distributed Data Management\" and \"Web Data Management\" can be used as a Databases course.\nNote: ** CS 858 can be used as a Hardware and Software Systems course or as an Algorithms and Complexity course, depending on the course offering.\nAdvanced courses taken in an undergraduate program as well as graduate courses can be used to meet the breadth requirement in each of the categories and areas. For example, at the University of Waterloo many of the 600-level graduate courses hold lectures in common with 400-level undergraduate courses. For the purposes of meeting the breadth requirement, the 400-level course is considered to be equivalent to the 600-level course. Although courses from other universities may not cover exactly the same material as the University of Waterloo courses, they will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee to determine if the topics covered and the depth of the material is appropriate. Offerings of CS 690B, CS 698, CS 798, CS 898 or equivalent may also count in an appropriate area. Courses offered by other departments may also have assigned areas.\nProcedure: within a month of entering a PhD program, a new student submits a document to the Graduate Committee detailing their relevant past courses and future plans. Written in consultation with the student's supervisor, it should indicate:\nCourses or equivalent (including theses) already taken by the student that fulfil part of the breadth requirement.\nA proposed program of study (including the terms during which the courses will be taken), which the student intends to complete in order to fulfil the remaining part of the breadth requirement.\nThe Graduate Committee must be able to determine the content, level and mark for courses used to fulfil the requirement as compared to courses at Waterloo. The student must provide sufficient evidence to convince the Committee that a course (or courses) listed does indeed fulfil an area requirement. Pertinent information includes course syllabi, textbooks used, descriptions of prerequisites or co-requisites, and references to university catalogues (web-based or otherwise accessible). The Graduate Committee will ask the student for more information or certification in cases of doubt and will consult with experts in the Department as it deems appropriate. The Graduate Committee will be the final arbiter of whether courses taken and marks obtained satisfy the requirements.\nBy the end of the student's first term in the program, the Committee will inform the student which categories and areas the submitted courses have satisfied and whether the submitted plan will suffice to complete the breadth requirement.\nA student must complete the breadth requirement by the end of their fourth term.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Computer Science program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nThe PhD Comprehensive Examination II is an oral presentation of a Research Proposal (not a Thesis Proposal) together with questioning by the Advisory Committee. The examination is normally held in camera. The candidate should convince the committee that the chosen research area is suitable and demonstrate an appropriate breadth of knowledge in the chosen area. The committee should decide if there is a thesis topic in the area and whether the candidate is capable of completing such a thesis. It is not required that the student should have already obtained new, publishable results in the proposed area.\nThe scope of the examination includes not only the research proposal, but also breadth in the chosen area. The student's supervisor is primarily responsible for the definition of what constitutes breadth.\nThe candidate should submit a written research proposal to each member of the committee and to the Director of Graduate Studies of the School of Computer Science at least two weeks prior to the examination. It is recommended that the research proposal be no longer than 20 pages in length. The research proposal should endeavour to convince the committee that the candidate can complete a thesis in the chosen area in the remaining time available to do so. However, it is not expected to contain new research results.\nPhD Seminar\nStudents must present at least 3 publicly announced seminars during the program. The purpose of this requirement is twofold: first, it ensures that each student participates in the academic life of the Department and, second, it provides an opportunity for students to hone their presentational skills. Each seminar should be attended by at least the student's supervisor and one other faculty member of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, who will be required to assess and approve the quality of the presentation.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must submit a thesis embodying the results of their own original research. Upon completion of the thesis, the student defends the final document before an examination board consisting of the supervisor, co-supervisor (if any), two faculty members from the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, one University of Waterloo faculty member external to the School of Computer Science and an external examiner. The examination exposes the student's work to scholarly criticism and gives the student the opportunity to defend it.\nRelevant links\nDavid R.

Admittance will be decided based on the student’s progress to date, and is subject to approval by the student’s supervisor(s) and the Director of Graduate Studies in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science.\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nStudents who already have a Master's degree must take 4 additional one-term Computer Science graduate courses after the Master's degree. At least 1 of these courses must be at the 800 level, and at most 1 can be at the 600 level.\nStudents who enter the PhD program directly from a bachelor's degree must take 8 additional one-term Computer Science graduate courses after the bachelor's degree. At least 3 of these courses must be at the 800 level, and at most 3 can be at the 600 level.\nNote: courses need to be selected from the Categories and Areas table but exceptions can be granted by the School of Computer Science.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Internship\nStudents are required to complete one or more four-month internships working on a topic related to their program. The internships will be arranged by the student, possibly with assistance from the supervisor. The internship must be approved by the supervisor and the Director of Graduate Studies in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science. At most two consecutive terms can be taken for an internship. An internship may not be taken in the student's final term.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I\nThe Comprehensive I requirement (\"breadth requirement\") ensures that a student has sufficient breadth of knowledge to undertake research at the PhD level. A student meets the requirement by taking a number of advanced courses in a broad range of categories and areas. The courses used must all have a minimum mark of 78% (or equivalent).\nCategories and Areas for Breadth Requirement: the breadth requirement divides the subject matter of computer science into three broad categories. Each category is subdivided into areas that represent a range of the fields of computer science, as given in the table below. The table also indicates where computer science courses at the University of Waterloo fit in these categories and areas. A student must have at least 1 advanced course in six of the eleven areas, including at least one area from each category:\nCategory\nArea\nComputer Science (CS) courses\nComputing Technology\nSoftware Engineering\nCS 645, CS 646, CS 647, CS 745, CS 746, CS 846\nProgramming Languages\nCS 642, CS 644, CS 744, CS 747, CS 842\nHardware and Software Systems\nCS 650, CS 651, CS 652, CS 654, CS 655, CS 656, CS 657, CS 658, CS 755, CS 758, CS 854, CS 856, CS 858**,CS 869\nMathematics of Computing\nAlgorithms and Complexity\nCS 662, CS 664, CS 666, CS 758, CS 761, CS 762, CS 763, CS 764, CS 765, CS 767, CS 840, CS 858**, CS 860\nScientific and Symbolic Computing\nCS 670, CS 672, CS 675, CS 676, CS 679, CS 687, CS 770, CS 774, CS 775, CS 778, CS 779, CS 780, CS 794, CS 870, CS 887\nComputational Statistics\nCS 680, CS 685, CS 786, CS 794, CS 885\nQuantum Information and Computation\nCS 766, CS 768, CS 867\nApplications\nArtificial Intelligence\nCS 679, CS 684, CS 686, CS 784, CS 785, CS 787, CS 886\nDatabases\nCS 640, CS 648, CS 740, CS 741, CS 742, CS 743, CS 848, CS 856*\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nCS 649, CS 688, CS 781, CS 783, CS 788, CS 789, CS 791, CS 888, CS 889\nBioinformatics\nCS 682, CS 782, CS 882\nHealth Informatics\nCS 792\nNote: * The versions of CS 856 entitled \"Internet-Scale Distributed Data Management\" and \"Web Data Management\" can be used as a Databases course.\nNote: ** CS 858 can be used as a Hardware and Software Systems course or as an Algorithms and Complexity course, depending on the course offering.\nAdvanced courses taken in an undergraduate program as well as graduate courses can be used to meet the breadth requirement in each of the categories and areas. For example, at the University of Waterloo many of the 600-level graduate courses hold lectures in common with 400-level undergraduate courses. For the purposes of meeting the breadth requirement, the 400-level course is considered to be equivalent to the 600-level course. Although courses from other universities may not cover exactly the same material as the University of Waterloo courses, they will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee to determine if the topics covered and the depth of the material is appropriate. Offerings of CS 690B, CS 698, CS 798, CS 898 or equivalent may also count in an appropriate area. Courses offered by other departments may also have assigned areas.\nProcedure: within a month of entering a PhD program, a new student submits a document to the Graduate Committee detailing their relevant past courses and future plans. Written in consultation with the student's supervisor, it should indicate:\nCourses or equivalent (including theses) already taken by the student that fulfil part of the breadth requirement.\nA proposed program of study (including the terms during which the courses will be taken), which the student intends to complete in order to fulfil the remaining part of the breadth requirement.\nThe Graduate Committee must be able to determine the content, level and mark for courses used to fulfil the requirement as compared to courses at Waterloo. The student must provide sufficient evidence to convince the Committee that a course (or courses) listed does indeed fulfil an area requirement. Pertinent information includes course syllabi, textbooks used, descriptions of prerequisites or co-requisites, and references to university catalogues (web-based or otherwise accessible). The Graduate Committee will ask the student for more information or certification in cases of doubt and will consult with experts in the Department as it deems appropriate. The Graduate Committee will be the final arbiter of whether courses taken and marks obtained satisfy the requirements.\nBy the end of the student's first term in the program, the Committee will inform the student which categories and areas the submitted courses have satisfied and whether the submitted plan will suffice to complete the breadth requirement.\nA student must complete the breadth requirement by the end of their fourth term.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Computer Science program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nThe PhD Comprehensive Examination II is an oral presentation of a Research Proposal (not a Thesis Proposal) together with questioning by the Advisory Committee. The examination is normally held in camera. The candidate should convince the committee that the chosen research area is suitable and demonstrate an appropriate breadth of knowledge in the chosen area. The committee should decide if there is a thesis topic in the area and whether the candidate is capable of completing such a thesis. It is not required that the student should have already obtained new, publishable results in the proposed area.\nThe scope of the examination includes not only the research proposal, but also breadth in the chosen area. The student's supervisor is primarily responsible for the definition of what constitutes breadth.\nThe candidate should submit a written research proposal to each member of the committee and to the Director of Graduate Studies of the School of Computer Science at least two weeks prior to the examination. It is recommended that the research proposal be no longer than 20 pages in length. The research proposal should endeavour to convince the committee that the candidate can complete a thesis in the chosen area in the remaining time available to do so. However, it is not expected to contain new research results.\nPhD Seminar\nStudents must present at least 3 publicly announced seminars during the program. The purpose of this requirement is twofold: first, it ensures that each student participates in the academic life of the Department and, second, it provides an opportunity for students to hone their presentational skills. Each seminar should be attended by at least the student's supervisor and one other faculty member of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, who will be required to assess and approve the quality of the presentation.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must submit a thesis embodying the results of their own original research. Upon completion of the thesis, the student defends the final document before an examination board consisting of the supervisor, co-supervisor (if any), two faculty members from the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, one University of Waterloo faculty member external to the School of Computer Science and an external examiner. The examination exposes the student's work to scholarly criticism and gives the student the opportunity to defend it.\nRelevant links\nDavid R.

            "Milestone requirements": "PhD Comprehensive Examination I\nThe Comprehensive I requirement (\"breadth requirement\") ensures that a student has sufficient breadth of knowledge to undertake research at the PhD level. A student meets the requirement by taking a number of advanced courses in a broad range of categories and areas. The courses used must all have a minimum mark of 78% (or equivalent).\nCategories and Areas for Breadth Requirement: the breadth requirement divides the subject matter of computer science into three broad categories. Each category is subdivided into areas that represent a range of the fields of computer science, as given in the table below. The table also indicates where computer science courses at the University of Waterloo fit in these categories and areas. A student must have at least 1 advanced course in six of the eleven areas, including at least one area from each category:\nCategory\nArea\nComputer Science (CS) courses\nComputing Technology\nSoftware Engineering\nCS 645, CS 646, CS 647, CS 745, CS 746, CS 846\nProgramming Languages\nCS 642, CS 644, CS 744, CS 747, CS 842\nHardware and Software Systems\nCS 650, CS 651, CS 652, CS 654, CS 655, CS 656, CS 657, CS 658, CS 755, CS 758, CS 854, CS 856, CS 858**,CS 869\nMathematics of Computing\nAlgorithms and Complexity\nCS 662, CS 664, CS 666, CS 758, CS 761, CS 762, CS 763, CS 764, CS 765, CS 767, CS 840, CS 858**, CS 860\nScientific and Symbolic Computing\nCS 670, CS 672, CS 675, CS 676, CS 679, CS 687, CS 770, CS 774, CS 775, CS 778, CS 779, CS 780, CS 794, CS 870, CS 887\nComputational Statistics\nCS 680, CS 685, CS 786, CS 794, CS 885\nQuantum Information and Computation\nCS 766, CS 768, CS 867\nApplications\nArtificial Intelligence\nCS 679, CS 684, CS 686, CS 784, CS 785, CS 787, CS 886\nDatabases\nCS 640, CS 648, CS 740, CS 741, CS 742, CS 743, CS 848, CS 856*\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nCS 649, CS 688, CS 781, CS 783, CS 788, CS 789, CS 791, CS 888, CS 889\nBioinformatics\nCS 682, CS 782, CS 882\nHealth Informatics\nCS 792\nNote: * The versions of CS 856 entitled \"Internet-Scale Distributed Data Management\" and \"Web Data Management\" can be used as a Databases course.\nNote: ** CS 858 can be used as a Hardware and Software Systems course or as an Algorithms and Complexity course, depending on the course offering.\nAdvanced courses taken in an undergraduate program as well as graduate courses can be used to meet the breadth requirement in each of the categories and areas. For example, at the University of Waterloo many of the 600-level graduate courses hold lectures in common with 400-level undergraduate courses. For the purposes of meeting the breadth requirement, the 400-level course is considered to be equivalent to the 600-level course. Although courses from other universities may not cover exactly the same material as the University of Waterloo courses, they will be evaluated by the Graduate Committee to determine if the topics covered and the depth of the material is appropriate. Offerings of CS 690B, CS 698, CS 798, CS 898 or equivalent may also count in an appropriate area. Courses offered by other departments may also have assigned areas.\nProcedure: within a month of entering a PhD program, a new student submits a document to the Graduate Committee detailing their relevant past courses and future plans. Written in consultation with the student's supervisor, it should indicate:\nCourses or equivalent (including theses) already taken by the student that fulfil part of the breadth requirement.\nA proposed program of study (including the terms during which the courses will be taken), which the student intends to complete in order to fulfil the remaining part of the breadth requirement.\nThe Graduate Committee must be able to determine the content, level and mark for courses used to fulfil the requirement as compared to courses at Waterloo. The student must provide sufficient evidence to convince the Committee that a course (or courses) listed does indeed fulfil an area requirement. Pertinent information includes course syllabi, textbooks used, descriptions of prerequisites or co-requisites, and references to university catalogues (web-based or otherwise accessible). The Graduate Committee will ask the student for more information or certification in cases of doubt and will consult with experts in the Department as it deems appropriate. The Graduate Committee will be the final arbiter of whether courses taken and marks obtained satisfy the requirements.\nBy the end of the student's first term in the program, the Committee will inform the student which categories and areas the submitted courses have satisfied and whether the submitted plan will suffice to complete the breadth requirement.\nA student must complete the breadth requirement by the end of their fourth term.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the",

The main objective of this examination is to satisfy the Department that the candidate has a broad knowledge of their field and a thorough technical background to pursue their research; the candidate will be questioned on their background preparation.\nThe second exam, the Comprehensive Proposal Examination, will be held no later than the student's sixth term and only after the Background Comprehensive Examination has been successfully completed. The main objective of this examination is to examine and approve the thesis proposal.\nThe result of these examinations is the identification of an Advisory Committee which has examined and approved the candidate's background and thesis proposal and is willing to assist the supervisor with the subsequent research program. The validity of the comprehensive examination expires after three years.\nStudents who do not complete either Comprehensive Examination by the stated deadline, or fail either exam on their second attempt, will be required to withdraw from the program.\nThe Background Comprehensive Examination Committee does not include the supervisor(s) and must consist of three members of the University, one of whom must be from ECE and two of whom can be internal or external to ECE (but within the University of Waterloo). The Proposal Comprehensive Examination Committee must consist of the supervisor(s) plus three members of the University, two of whom must be from ECE and one of whom must be external to ECE (but within the University of Waterloo). It is the supervisor’s responsibility to form each of these committees.\nDetailed procedures are available in the “PhD comprehensive examination process” section of the\nElectrical and Computer Engineering website\n.\nPhD Seminar\nThe aim of the seminar is to allow students to gain experience in preparing and presenting their work. The seminar is to be held no later than the end of the third year (ninth term) after the initial registration in the program. The seminar must be attended by the student’s supervisor and their Advisory Committee. Other Faculty members and PhD and MASc students may also be in attendance. Since this is not intended to be an examination, the seminar presentation and the feedback communication, would be regarded as satisfying the seminar credit requirements.\nStudents who do not complete the PhD Seminar by the stated deadline will be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nThe primary objective of the program is the accomplishment of independent and original research work and reporting thereon in a research thesis.\nThe requirements for the PhD degree are completed when the student successfully defends their thesis before an Examination Committee. This committee should consist of the supervisor, three other members of the University (at least one of whom should be from outside the Department) and an external examiner. Faculty from other Departments who hold cross appointments in the Department are counted as departmental members in defining examining committees.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Electrical and Computer Engineering future students program page\nfile_upload",

The Proposal Comprehensive Examination Committee must consist of the supervisor(s) plus three members of the University, two of whom must be from ECE and one of whom must be external to ECE (but within the University of Waterloo). It is the supervisor’s responsibility to form each of these committees.\nDetailed procedures are available in the “PhD comprehensive examination process” section of the\nElectrical and Computer Engineering website\n.\nPhD Quantum Information Seminar\nStudents must fulfill a PhD Quantum Information Seminar milestone (scheduled with the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC)) consisting of 1 IQC seminar, the Quantum Information seminar may simultaneously count towards the PhD Seminar requirement of the ECE Department.\nPhD Seminar\nThe aim of the PhD Seminar (scheduled with the ECE Department) is to allow students to gain experience in preparing and presenting their work. The seminar is to be held no later than the end of the third year after the initial registration in the program. The seminar must be attended by the student’s supervisor and their Advisory Committee. Other Faculty members and PhD and MASc students may also be in attendance. Since this is not intended to be an examination, the seminar presentation and the feedback communication, would be regarded as satisfying the seminar credit requirements.\nStudents who do not complete the PhD Seminar by the stated deadline will be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must complete an original research thesis in Quantum Information and an oral defense.\nThe primary objective of the program is the accomplishment of independent and original research work and reporting thereon in a research thesis.\nThe requirements for the PhD degree are completed when the student successfully defends their thesis before an Examination Committee. This committee should consist of the supervisor, three other members of the University (at least one of whom should be from outside the Department) and an external examiner. Faculty from other Departments who hold cross appointments in the Department are counted as departmental members in defining examining committees.\nA list of approved Quantum Information thesis supervisors is available on the\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering website\n.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Quantum Information future students program page\nfile_upload",

For a course outside the University of Waterloo, the Ontario Visiting Graduate Student (OVGS) form must be completed. For a course inside the University, the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee must approve. In either case, the Department's Graduate Office must be supplied with a syllabus in electronic form and the course must be approved before the beginning of the term in which it is scheduled to run.\nIf students can demonstrate that a reading course is necessary to their overall program, they may petition the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee to allow such an independent course. Directed reading courses must be designed and submitted to the Graduate Committee by the instructor in consultation with the student, and the course outline (with rationale, reading list, assignments and schedule) must be approved by the Graduate Committee in the term prior to the one in which the course is to be run. A reading course will not be approved if a course in a similar area, or with the same faculty member, will be taught that year; if the proposed course overlaps substantially with work that is also to be credited as an MRP or thesis; or if it would not be feasible within that term’s scheduling and enrolment constraints. Students are permitted to take only 1 reading course as part of the degree.\nTo graduate candidates must receive an average of 78% in their courses. To remain eligible for funding, candidates must maintain an 80% average. If a student receives one failing grade or two grades lower than 70%, the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee will review the candidate's standing in the program. The candidate may be asked to withdraw from the program.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Language Requirement\nBy the end of the seventh term, each candidate must demonstrate basic competence in a language other than English (excluding Middle English but not Old English). First languages are normally accepted, as is the completion of two University-level courses of language study or passing a departmentally approved language exam. Candidates must consult with the Department’s Associate Chair, Graduate Studies, to confirm what criteria will satisfy the Language Requirement milestone and to clarify the evidence that should be provided.\nPhD Research Seminar\nThe PhD Research Seminar (also referred to as the Professionalization Training Requirement) is a course on the development of research skills and professionalization, to be offered to second-year PhD students in the Fall term of every year that will meet weekly. The course will cover such topics as: preparation for area exams, preparation of a dissertation proposal, bibliographical skills, teaching strategies, the job market (academic and non-academic), conferences, writing for publication, curriculum vitae preparation, interview technique, and writing of grant applications.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the Faculty of Arts Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements with the exception that in the Faculty of Arts, the Graduate Chair can approve the committee for comprehensive examinations.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in English program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nAt the end of their coursework and preliminary to writing the dissertation, candidates are required to sit two examinations: one written and one oral. Normally this will occur in year two.\nThe written examination will comprise the candidate’s dissertation field. The examination will be followed by an oral defence of examination questions and reading lists. The oral defence will take place at the same time as the dissertation proposal defence (see below).\nThe written examination will be based on a list of readings to be composed by the candidate and their committee.\nThe written examination will be administered online in a 7-day take-home format.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nUpon successful completion of the comprehensive examination and proposal defences, candidates begin full-time work on their dissertations. Candidates must first prepare a dissertation proposal which includes a 3000-word description of the proposed research and a working bibliography of the primary and secondary texts that will serve as the source material for that research. These documents should be prepared in consultation with the supervisor and the other members of the candidate's Supervisory Committee. The deadline for submission and defence of the proposal will normally be during the fifth term of study. Candidates who fail their comprehensive examination must first re-sit the examination before submitting the dissertation proposal. Failure to submit a dissertation proposal by the deadline will normally result in candidates losing their satisfactory standing in the Doctoral program along with their internal funding. If the submitted dissertation proposal is deemed to be unsatisfactory, candidates must revise and resubmit within a period to be determined by the committee. Candidates who fail to submit a satisfactory proposal in the second attempt may be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nWhen a candidate has selected a supervisor, they will together seek two other members of the Faculty to form a Dissertation Committee. This committee is subject to the approval of the Graduate Committee of the Department. The dissertation will be an original study on a topic agreed upon by the candidate, graduate supervisor, and the Dissertation Committee. The dissertation will normally run 250 to 400 pages of typescript.\nOnce a candidate submits the dissertation for assessment, a committee for the oral defense will be struck.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of English Language and Literature website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in English future students program page\nfile_upload",

The student supervisor (in consultation with the student) and the Associate Director, Research and Doctoral Studies will need to approve the course selection.\nThe student’s supervisor, in consultation with the student and the Associate Director, Research and Doctoral Studies, may advise the student to take additional courses, anytime during the program, if the courses directly advance the student’s work on their thesis.\nTo maintain good standing during the coursework, students must maintain a minimum average of 75%.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the\nFaculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements\n:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering completion timelines whereby students shall complete their comprehensive examination before the end of their 4th term or 6th term in cases where the student is admitted to the PhD program without a completed Master’s degree.\nCommittee: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering committee composition guidelines which differ from the University-level minimum requirements in both number of committee members and committee makeup.\nWho Chairs an examination: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering Chair guidelines whereby the Chair is normally selected from outside of the student’s home department.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements but with additional information provided in the Faculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Entrepreneurship and Organization program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nThe comprehensive examination questions will be proposed by the comprehensive examination committee. The committee will consist of faculty members that have taught the core courses. In the comprehensive examination, the examination committee will assign three research questions to the students. Students will select one of these questions or suggest a slightly modified version of one of the questions. In all cases the question(s) must serve to require the substantive breadth covering different courses. Students will write a research study that will address this question. The research study will include relevant background information, literature review, hypotheses, discussion of potential methods to test the hypotheses, a description of how results will be interpreted, and a discussion of possible problems in implementing the method and how those problems could be addressed. Students must submit the written study 10-14 days before the oral examination with the comprehension examination committee.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nStudents must present their thesis proposal to a Thesis Examination Committee. Students are required to follow the thesis proposal requirements outlined in the Faculty of Engineering minimum requirements. In addition, the exam will include a critical assessment of students’ thesis proposal based on a written report provided in advance. The student must submit the thesis proposal to the Thesis Committee at least one month prior to the examination. The thesis committee will assess students’ thesis proposal on the basis of its potential contribution to knowledge (originality, quality, quantity), research adequacy and thoroughness, understanding of the subject (review of previous work, choice of project), suggested theoretical framework, methods, and presentation (organization, grammar, style, bibliography). Students must present their thesis proposal by the end of the 8th term.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must submit and defend a thesis by the end of the 12th term or the fourth year. A thesis must ensure that breadth of knowledge and skills are acquired by doctoral candidates through highly specialized, independent, original research which makes a distinct contribution of knowledge to the entrepreneurship and organization discipline. Students are required to follow the thesis examination requirements outlined in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. The candidate will submit and later defend their thesis to their Thesis Committee.\nRelevant links\nConrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Entrepreneurship and Organization future students program page\nfile_upload",

Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nMaster's Thesis\nThe thesis should demonstrate the student’s ability to conduct original research under the guidance of a faculty member. Furthermore a successful thesis in the program demonstrates knowledge of existing research within the area of inquiry, the development of a sound research question and the ability to apply appropriate methods. The results of research should be original and contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the selected field. The thesis should be approximately 100 pages.",

The Advisory Committee will normally have three or four members. At least two members of the Committee must have majority appointments in the SERS (at least one of whom must be a non‐supervising member). At least one non‐supervising member must be external to the SERS, and is referred to as the “internal‐external” member. If the supervisor does not have a regular appointment at the University of Waterloo, then the Advisory Committee must include a co‐supervisor who has a majority appointment in ERS. The supervisor or one of the co‐supervisors must be accredited at the University of Waterloo with Sole-Supervisory Privilege Status (SSPS2).\nThe candidate will be required to submit a dissertation proposal to his or her committee in time to defend it by the end of his or her second year (sixth term) in the program. In exceptional cases an extension to allow defence of the proposal in the seventh term may be permitted.\nBefore approving the proposal in cases where the proposed dissertation research depends significantly on texts and/or interviews and/or other communication in a language other than English, the dissertation supervisory committee must determine whether the candidate has sufficient proficiency in that language. If the candidate does not have sufficient proficiency in the view of the committee, the committee must prescribe suitable means for the candidate to achieve the necessary proficiency for the particular circumstances of the case. This may include requirements to take formal courses at the University and/or special training courses at the research location.\nUpon formal approval of the proposal by the dissertation supervisory committee, the candidate proceeds to the research and writing of the dissertation.

The advisory committee must be formed during the student’s first year in the program.\nNormally, and in keeping with University of Waterloo regulations, students should complete and defend the dissertation within four years of starting the program. This time limit can be extended only by following the procedures outlined in the University of Waterloo’s Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. Students may also fast‐track and complete the program more quickly, but in no less than three years. The dissertation must draw upon transdisciplinary inquiry and it must be no more than 70,000 words in length.\nBefore the oral defence is scheduled, each student will be expected to have presented an element of his or her research at a minimum of one academic conference and submitted at least one paper from the research to a refereed journal.\nWhen the dissertation is ready for defence, including completion of revisions recommended by the committee, an oral defence will be scheduled. The Doctoral Dissertation Examination Committee will consist of all members of the Advisory Committee; an External Examiner chosen by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who shall be provided with a list of appropriate external examiners recommended by the dissertation supervisor and the Program Director; an internal-external examiner (normally already a member of the Advisory Committee) nominated by the supervisor; and a Dissertation Examination Chair appointed by the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Environment, Resources and Sustainability website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Social and Ecological Sustainability future students program page\nfile_upload",

The Master of Environmental Studies (MES) curriculum includes both a methods course (either ERS 669 Applied Statistics in Ecology and Environment or ERS 625/GEOG 625 Qualitative Methods in Geography) and research skills training to develop a research proposal, but it is assumed that, normally, students coming into the PhD program will have equivalent training and experience. Students may also choose to take supplemental courses later in their program based on discussions with their advisory committee. They may also need to do so as a condition of a comprehensive examination outcome.\n\nStudents entering the PhD program from the MES may be required to take the PhD core courses but they may also be exempted from some coursework if their committee concludes that this is warranted based on their previous training.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Seminar\nStudents must publicly present some part of their PhD research to an audience in the Faculty of Environment. The purpose is not only to provide students with an opportunity to share their research work and to develop their communication skills, but to encourage an environment of collective knowledge development in the Department.\nCollaborative Research Seminar I\nStudents are required to present a seminar on their thesis or major paper research proposal and, if appropriate, early stage results to current and past Water students and Water Institute faculty members. Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nCollaborative Research Seminar II\nStudents who have completed the Collaborative Research Seminar 1 as part of their Masters Water degree, must complete the Collaborative Research Seminar 2.\nStudents are required to present a seminar on their PhD thesis proposal to current and past water students and Water Institute faculty members. Seminars will normally occur following the completion of required courses and the comprehensive exam. Seminars should present how learnings from the Collaborative Water Program were applied in, or influenced, thesis proposals. Seminars will normally be poster presentations or talks at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis proposal; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nCollaborative Academic Contribution\nStudents who have completed the Collaborative Water Program Research Seminar 1 as part of their Masters Water degree, must complete the Collaborative Academic Contribution milestone.\nStudents are required to make an academic contribution to the Collaborative Water Program. The proposed contribution will be documented by the student and approved by the student’s Supervisor and the Collaborative Water Program Director. Potential contributions may include, but not be limited to:\nDevelopment of new or improved curricula or course content;\nDelivery of a lecture(s);\nPreparation of a publication;\nPreparation of a case study;\nMentorship of a group of students.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements.\nDetailed procedures are available in the “\nPhD comprehensive examination process\n” section of the School of Environment, Resources and Sustainability website.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nA dissertation supervisory committee, composed of a supervisor and two faculty of the SERS program (or one SERS faculty and one from another department), will be formed by the student with the agreement of the Program Director and the approval of the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. Each supervisor must be accredited at the University of Waterloo with Sole-Supervisory Privilege Status (SSPS2).\nThe candidate will be required to submit a dissertation proposal to his or her committee in time to defend it by the end of his or her second year (sixth term) in the program. In exceptional cases an extension to allow defence of the proposal in the seventh term may be permitted.\nBefore approving the proposal in cases where the proposed dissertation research depends significantly on texts and/or interviews and/or other communication in a language other than English, the dissertation supervisory committee must determine whether the candidate has sufficient proficiency in that language. If the candidate does not have sufficient proficiency in the view of the committee, the committee must prescribe suitable means for the candidate to achieve the necessary proficiency for the particular circumstances of the case. This may include requirements to take formal courses at the University and/or special training courses at the research location.\nUpon formal approval of the proposal by the dissertation supervisory committee, the candidate proceeds to the research and writing of the dissertation. Candidates who fail to satisfy the dissertation proposal presentation and defence requirement within the established time frame will be asked to leave the program.\nPhD Thesis\nDoctoral students in the SERS are expected to define their own area of focus and research agenda, though in consultation with their advisors and other committee members.\nEach student’s work in developing the dissertation proposal, conducting the research, and completing the dissertation will be done in close communication with the advisor and assisted by other members of his or her advisory committee. The advisory committee must be formed during the student’s first year in the program.\nNormally, and in keeping with University of Waterloo regulations, students should complete and defend the dissertation within four years of starting the program. This time limit can be extended only by following the procedures outlined in the University of Waterloo’s Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. Students may also fast‐track and complete the program more quickly, but in no less than three years. The dissertation must draw upon transdisciplinary inquiry and it must be no more than 70,000 words in length.\nBefore the oral defence is scheduled, each student will be expected to have presented an element of his or her research at a minimum of one academic conference and submitted at least one paper from the research to a refereed journal.\nWhen the dissertation is ready for defence, including completion of revisions recommended by the committee, an oral defence will be scheduled. The Doctoral Dissertation Examination Committee will consist of all members of the Supervisory Committee; an External Examiner chosen by the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who shall be provided with a list of appropriate External Examiners recommended by the thesis supervisor and the Program Director; an Internal‐External Examiner nominated by the supervisor; and a Dissertation Examination Chair appointed by the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Environment, Resources and Sustainability website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Social and Ecological Sustainability - Water future students program page\nfile_upload",

Normally the Examination involves the student writing answers to a question or questions over a period of three weeks. The answer(s) will not exceed 10,000 words, excluding the bibliography, abstract, figures and tables. In the oral component of the Examination, which normally lasts no longer than three hours, the student defends the written document. The topics to be covered and the format of the Examination are determined by the student’s Comprehensive Examination Committee, in consultation with the student.\nThe Comprehensive Examining Committee will consist of the student’s Supervisor plus three additional Examiners, all of whom must hold a PhD (or equivalent) degree. The supervisor, along with one of the committee members, must hold a faculty appointment inside the Department of Geography and Environmental Management and at least one of the two GEM members must hold a tenured or tenure-track position. Of the remaining two members, one must have a faculty appointment at the University of Waterloo but outside the Department of Geography and Environmental Management (normally, this person will be internal to the University of Waterloo).\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nStudents develop a thesis proposal that will be approved by their Supervisor and Comprehensive Examining Committee, normally before the end of the second year.\nPhD Thesis\nUpon approval of the thesis proposal, students will then proceed to the research and writing of the thesis.

Students may elect to take an elective course outside of GEOG or GEMCC with approval of the Graduate Officer.\n\nThis degree is offered through the Collaborative Water Program. This program, jointly offered by a range of departments across several academic faculties, promotes the development of interdisciplinary perspectives on water. Collaborative Water Program students complete their specialist training in their respective home departments, while working with colleagues from a variety of other departments in core interdisciplinary courses (WATER 601 and WATER 602).\n\nFailure to obtain a final grade of at least 70% in each course will result in an automatic review of the student’s status in the program, which may require that the student withdraw from the program.\n\nThe coursework part of the program is designed to develop advanced understanding of issues relating to environmental science and geomatics, and also to provide students with training in additional methods/skills for their thesis research and its defence.\nThesis option: Milestone requirements\nCollaborative Research Seminar I\nStudents are required to present a seminar on their thesis or major paper research proposal and, if appropriate, early stage results to current and past Water students and Water Institute faculty members. Seminars will normally occur following the completion of WATER 601 and WATER 602. Seminars will provide the opportunity for students to discuss how learnings from Water courses were applied in, or influenced, research proposals or research work in the student’s home department. Seminars will normally be poster presentations at Water Institute organized events. The seminar is not an oral examination of the thesis or paper; rather, its purpose is to develop the student's ability to communicate their research in an organized and informative manner.\nMaster's Thesis Proposal\nDuring the first year, students develop a thesis proposal that will be approved by their supervisor and committee, normally before the end of the first year.\nMaster's Thesis\nUpon approval of the thesis proposal, students will then proceed to the research and writing of the thesis. Normally, students should complete and defend the thesis within two years of starting the program.\nOther requirements\nFieldwork: many students will engage in fieldwork as part of their research. Several courses provide experience and training, to complement what most students will have obtained in their undergraduate degrees. Individual faculty also provide specialized training before and during fieldwork activity. Fieldwork is subject to environmental and other impact assessment through NSERC funding reviews, as well as research permit applications in many jurisdictions where students work, e.g., in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Geography and Environmental Management website\nMaster of Science (MSc) in Geography - Water future students program page\nfile_upload",

Credit for the PhD Seminar will be assigned by the Program Director/Associate Director (equivalent to University of Waterloo Graduate Chair) on a credit/non-credit basis. The Seminar is designed to provide structured opportunities for meaningful interaction among students, with faculty and with outside researchers and policymakers, as well as to expose incoming PhD students to the range of opportunities for learning in the area of global governance within the Waterloo community.\nPhD Internship\nStudents may complete a four-to-eight month internship working on global governance issues in the public or private sector, at a research institute, or for a non-governmental organization. The “work-term,” for which no formal credit will be offered, would normally take place during the student’s second year in the PhD program.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I and PhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the Faculty of Arts Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: in Global Governance, the committee composition may include faculty from Wilfrid Laurier University due to the joint nature of the PhD program.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Global Governance program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nStudents write the core Global Governance exam based on a reading list of fifty (50) works set by the core Examination Committee which is normally comprised of three faculty members, at least one of whom would have taught the Global Governance, Methods, History or Economics courses (faculty may be from either the University of Waterloo or Wilfrid Laurier University due to the joint nature of the PhD program). The list of readings will be agreed upon by all committee members and sent to the students by May 1. The students will write the Global Governance exam in the beginning of September of Year Two.\nStudents then write a field exam related to the field of their proposed thesis topic. The field exam is set by a committee comprised normally of the student’s supervisor, the faculty member who taught the field course, and a third faculty member (faculty may be from either the University of Waterloo or Wilfrid Laurier University due to the joint nature of the PhD program). The field exam reading list will be finalized by the field committee in consultation with the student by May 1. The students will write their field exam two weeks after their core Global Governance exam.\nOutcomes of the comprehensive exam:\nStudents will receive one of three evaluations of their comprehensive exam: Passed, Passed Conditionally, and Reexamination. The Examination Committee’s evaluation will be determined by majority vote, with the one exception that a student will receive an evaluation of “Passed Conditionally” where the committee returns one vote for “Passed Conditionally” and two votes for “Reexamination.” When a student receives an evaluation of “Passed Conditionally,” the Program Director/Associate Director (equivalent to University of Waterloo Graduate Chair) will provide the student within ten (10) business days with a written report from the Examination Committee that outlines specifically those parts of the student’s examination that the student will need to elaborate upon and/or clarify. The student will then have thirty (30) days to submit a written response of no more than 1,000 words in which they will outline clarifications and/or revisions. The committee will then evaluate the response and determine by majority if the student has met the requirements for a “Pass.” If a student fails the first sitting of their examination, either after the initial written attempt or after the Passed Conditionally stage, they have the option to sit the examination a second time. When a student is re-examined, the outcomes are limited to: Passed, and Exam Unsuccessful. A result of Exam Unsuccessful will normally lead to expulsion from the doctoral program.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nSuccessful completion of the comprehensive examinations allows students to progress to the thesis proposal stage. Normally, students will defend their thesis proposal before a formal thesis supervisory committee at the midway point of year two in the program. This defence can take place no later than 18 months after a student’s entry into the program. A thesis supervisory committee, normally composed of a supervisor and two core faculty of the Global Governance program, will be formed by the student with the agreement of the Program Director/Associate Director (equivalent to University of Waterloo Graduate Chair). The student will be required to submit a thesis proposal to the committee. The committee will meet with the student to discuss the proposal. Upon formal approval, the student proceeds to the research and writing of the thesis. Students who fail to satisfy this requirement within the established time frame may be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nNormally, students should complete and defend the thesis within four years of starting the program. When a thesis is completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the thesis will be referred to the other members of the supervisory committee. After all committee members are satisfied with the thesis, including completion of revisions recommended by the committee, an oral defence will be scheduled. The regulations and procedures at the university where the student is registered will govern both the thesis and the examination formats and the composition of the thesis examining committee.\nOther requirements\nLanguage Requirement: prior to completion of the third year, students whose doctoral thesis is concerned with a non-English speaking country or region will be required to demonstrate proficiency in the language of that country. To fulfill the requirement, students will need to demonstrate proficiency in the second language, and may do so by completing designated language courses at either the University of Waterloo or Wilfrid Laurier University. Where there are no courses available, the Program Director/Associate Director (equivalent to University of Waterloo Graduate Chair) will determine the time and method of language assessment, in consultation with the student. The language requirement must be met before the doctoral student proceeds to the thesis stage.\nRelevant links\nBalsillie School of International Affairs website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Global Governance future students program page\nfile_upload",

The Tri-University's PhD program was begun in 1994 as a way of combining the two small, but well-established PhD programs at the University of Guelph and the University of Waterloo, with the members of the History department at Wilfrid Laurier University. This program integrates the skill and knowledge of over fifty faculty members and offers students a wide range of research approaches and expertise. In 2001 the successful Tri-University concept was extended to include the Master's degree in History.\nGraduate research fields\nCanadian History\nCold War Era History\nEarly Modern European History\nIndigenous History\nMedieval History\nModern European History\nRace, Imperialism and Slavery\nScottish History\nWar and Society\nWorld History\nAdmission requirements: Minimum requirements\nStudents will be admitted only after they have obtained a Master of Arts (MA) degree in which they have received at least an 83% standing. Only students who are graduates of accredited Universities and Colleges are eligible for admission. Since not all applicants can be admitted, close attention is paid to samples of applicants' written work, to applicants' transcripts and past record as a whole, and to their statement of research interests. Applications are considered by the Coordinating Committee of the Tri-University Graduate Program.\nStudents will not be accepted into the program without the agreement of the Coordinating Committee, the local Graduate Committee and the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the university at which they must register. No student will be assigned to a doctoral supervisor without approval from the supervisor.\nStatement of the applicant's research interests.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nFrom previous institutions.\nWriting sample\nSample of the student's scholarly writing.\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: academic\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nEach student is required to demonstrate competency in 1 major field and 2 minor areas. In the minor areas, competency is demonstrated by successful completion of 2 area seminars. In the major field, students must successfully complete a major field seminar (HIST 710-719), a written qualifying exam (HIST 704) and oral qualifying exam (HIST 701). All the major field seminars within the following areas of study are offered each year: Canadian history; early modern European history; Indigenous history; modern European history; race, imperialism and slavery; Scottish history; and war and society. The Coordinating Committee, in collaboration with the student, will establish the minor field seminars appropriate for that student.\nThe major field is the student’s primary area of concentration; it provides the background and context for thesis research and will, in all likelihood, serve as the area in which graduates apply for academic jobs. The basis of the major field is the major field reading list. Students are examined on their knowledge of their field list through a seminar, a major field written exam and a major field oral qualifying exam. These components of the major field will each be graded separately.\nThe major field reading list will consist of the equivalent of 100 books, approximately half of which will be read in the major field seminar and half by students independently. The major field seminar (HIST 710-719) must be successfully completed in the first year of the student’s program. The major field qualifying exams are normally taken at the beginning of the students’ fourth term in the program. In the major field qualifying exams students will be examined on their knowledge of the entire major field reading list. The exam will consist of a written portion (HIST 704) and an oral portion (HIST 701) with a separate grade assigned for each part. The oral portion of the exam will normally be held within two weeks of the successful completion of the written portion. Students may not complete the oral portion if they fail to pass the written, but they must pass the oral to successfully complete the examination process.\nThe minor areas represent the secondary areas of concentration; they are intended to provide students with a supplementary teaching area and a comparative understanding of works in their dissertation research area. These two goals may be combined in each minor area course or the director, in consultation with the student, the thesis advisor and the seminar instructors, may coordinate a program in which one area is primarily geared towards a second teaching area and the other towards developing an understanding of the students’ primary research areas beyond their major field. The reading list for each minor area seminar (HIST 759-771) will consist of the equivalent of 50 books. The minor area seminars are normally completed during the first two terms of the student’s program, however, students may choose to take their minor area seminars in their fourth and fifth terms.\nMinor field seminar instructors may require students to attend a one-term MA-level historiographical seminar in partial completion of their field requirement. A student who fails to pass either of their minor field seminars will be required to withdraw from the program. The minor field seminar reading list is drawn up by each minor field instructor. The minor field reading lists and outline will be deposited in the student’s file prior to the completion of the field.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Language Requirement\nIf no specific language is required for the student's research (as authorized by the student's Advisory Committee), the second language will be French. The determination of the second language will be made by the student's Advisory Committee in the first term of the student’s registration in the program. The language exam will be offered every Fall and Winter term and it is expected that a student will successfully complete the test no later than the sixth term following admission into the program.\nThe same requirement will hold for students whose native language is French except that it will be applied to a reading knowledge of English.\nThe language exam is intended to evaluate the candidate's reading knowledge of a second language and is not to be understood as a test of fluency. Use of a dictionary is allowed during the exam. A student who has already fulfilled a language requirement, for example through an equivalent exam previously taken, may have credit given for that work by their Advisory Committee. Completion of an undergraduate course is not in itself considered an equivalent.\nPhD Professional Development Seminar\nStudents must attend the Professional Development Seminar in their first year of the program. The seminar is designed to prepare students for success as a PhD student and for their future careers. A pass/fail grade will be assigned for the seminar.\nThe seminar will consist of 8 sessions covering a range of topic areas, including - the historians' craft (researching, conferencing, and publishing), careers (teaching and non-teaching work) and keys to success as a graduate student (applying for grants, and success as a teaching assistant). Seminars will rotate across each of the three campuses. Attendance and/or participation in the Tri-University Conference is included in the Professional Development Seminar.\nGraduate Studies Colloquium\nThe colloquium is a public presentation of a chapter, significant portion, or summary of the student's thesis. In exceptional circumstances, the Advisory Committee may also approve the presentation of a paper on another topic. The colloquium paper will be presented within three terms of the completion of the thesis proposal. A grade of pass/fail will be assigned for the colloquium.\nThe exact scheduling will be determined by the supervisor/advisor in consultation with the student and the Advisory Committee. Students are expected to consult with their Advisory Committee on a suitable topic for the colloquium. An abstract of the colloquium paper must be approved by the Supervisory Committee before the supervisor/advisor can schedule the colloquium defense. The entire committee will be provided with copies of the colloquium paper at a minimum of no less than one week in advance of the presentation. The student will present the paper orally (normally no more than 20 minutes) after which committee members will examine the candidate on their draft chapter and presentation. The colloquium presentation is a public event. Time permitting, guests attending the colloquium will be invited to ask questions following the formal examination. A pass/fail grade will be assigned by the Committee at the end of the examination.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nAll doctoral students will present a thesis proposal of no more than 2000 words including citations by the end of the Fall or Winter term (whichever comes first) following the completion of their three fields. The student will be examined orally on the proposal by the Advisory Committee within four weeks of submission of the proposal to the director and a pass/fail grade will be assigned.\nPhD Thesis\nFollowing successful completion of all other requirements, the student must complete, under the supervision of a tri-university doctoral program faculty member, an original research project on an advanced topic. Each student will be required to write and successfully defend a thesis of such cogency and originality as will represent a significant contribution to knowledge. The thesis will normally be between 50,000 and 90,000 words in length. The regulations and procedures at the university in which the student is enrolled will govern the thesis format and the thesis examination.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of History website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in History future students program page\nfile_upload",

These two goals may be combined in each minor area course or the director, in consultation with the student, the thesis advisor and the seminar instructors, may coordinate a program in which one area is primarily geared towards a second teaching area and the other towards developing an understanding of the students’ primary research areas beyond their major field. The reading list for each minor area seminar (HIST 759-771) will consist of the equivalent of 50 books. The minor area seminars are normally completed during the first two terms of the student’s program, however, students may choose to take their minor area seminars in their fourth and fifth terms.\nMinor field seminar instructors may require students to attend a one-term MA-level historiographical seminar in partial completion of their field requirement. A student who fails to pass either of their minor field seminars will be required to withdraw from the program. The minor field seminar reading list is drawn up by each minor field instructor. The minor field reading lists and outline will be deposited in the student’s file prior to the completion of the field.",
            "Milestone requirements": "PhD Language Requirement\nIf no specific language is required for the student's research (as authorized by the student's Advisory Committee), the second language will be French. The determination of the second language will be made by the student's Advisory Committee in the first term of the student’s registration in the program. The language exam will be offered every Fall and Winter term and it is expected that a student will successfully complete the test no later than the sixth term following admission into the program.\nThe same requirement will hold for students whose native language is French except that it will be applied to a reading knowledge of English.\nThe language exam is intended to evaluate the candidate's reading knowledge of a second language and is not to be understood as a test of fluency. Use of a dictionary is allowed during the exam. A student who has already fulfilled a language requirement, for example through an equivalent exam previously taken, may have credit given for that work by their Advisory Committee. Completion of an undergraduate course is not in itself considered an equivalent.\nPhD Professional Development Seminar\nStudents must attend the Professional Development Seminar in their first year of the program. The seminar is designed to prepare students for success as a PhD student and for their future careers. A pass/fail grade will be assigned for the seminar.\nThe seminar will consist of 8 sessions covering a range of topic areas, including - the historians' craft (researching, conferencing, and publishing), careers (teaching and non-teaching work) and keys to success as a graduate student (applying for grants, and success as a teaching assistant). Seminars will rotate across each of the three campuses. Attendance and/or participation in the Tri-University Conference is included in the Professional Development Seminar.\nGraduate Studies Colloquium\nThe colloquium is a public presentation of a chapter, significant portion, or summary of the student's thesis. In exceptional circumstances, the Advisory Committee may also approve the presentation of a paper on another topic. The colloquium paper will be presented within three terms of the completion of the thesis proposal. A grade of pass/fail will be assigned for the colloquium.\nThe exact scheduling will be determined by the supervisor/advisor in consultation with the student and the Advisory Committee. Students are expected to consult with their Advisory Committee on a suitable topic for the colloquium. An abstract of the colloquium paper must be approved by the Supervisory Committee before the supervisor/advisor can schedule the colloquium defense. The entire committee will be provided with copies of the colloquium paper at a minimum of no less than one week in advance of the presentation. The student will present the paper orally (normally no more than 20 minutes) after which committee members will examine the candidate on their draft chapter and presentation. The colloquium presentation is a public event. Time permitting, guests attending the colloquium will be invited to ask questions following the formal examination. A pass/fail grade will be assigned by the Committee at the end of the examination.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nAll doctoral students will present a thesis proposal of no more than 2000 words including citations by the end of the Fall or Winter term (whichever comes first) following the completion of their three fields. The student will be examined orally on the proposal by the Advisory Committee within four weeks of submission of the proposal to the director and a pass/fail grade will be assigned.\nPhD Thesis\nFollowing successful completion of all other requirements, the student must complete, under the supervision of a tri-university doctoral program faculty member, an original research project on an advanced topic. Each student will be required to write and successfully defend a thesis of such cogency and originality as will represent a significant contribution to knowledge. The thesis will normally be between 50,000 and 90,000 words in length. The regulations and procedures at the university in which the student is enrolled will govern the thesis format and the thesis examination.",

Primary source materials must form the basis of thesis research, the goal of which is to contribute to original analysis either by consulting new material or by applying new historiographical insights or methods. A thesis carries the weight of four 0.50 credit courses, and its normal length is approximately 120-150 pages of double-spaced type. An oral defence is required.\nStudents will register for their thesis at the end of the first term. The thesis should be completed no later than the student's third term of full-time registration in the program.\nStudents who register in the thesis option must write a proposal which includes the tentative title, a rationale for the proposed research project and a list of sources to be used. Students will first identify a general area, time period, and/or problem upon which they wish to focus their research. From the list of research interests of the faculty they will then proceed to discuss the possibilities for a topic with the appropriate faculty member(s). Once a faculty member, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty, has agreed to act as a supervisor, the student will inform the Graduate Officer who in turn will present this information to the Director of the Tri-University Graduate Program. The student, in consultation with the supervisor, will define the research topic and a viable body of primary sources, and submit a research proposal to the supervisor.\nNo student may register in the thesis option for more than one term without an approved thesis proposal.\nStudents in the thesis option will submit their research proposals and undertake their research projects in consultation with an Advisory Committee consisting of their supervisor and at least two other readers/advisors. An Advisory Committee may be composed from any of the faculty in the Tri-University Graduate Program in History, provided those faculty are members of the Graduate Faculty at their respective institutions. The Advisory Committees will be set up in conjunction with the deadlines established for student submission of proposals for the thesis.

Program Intensive 2 takes place over 10 days in April (at the end of the program). Students will be presented with a complex challenge from our industry partners, for which they will develop a business solution based on relevant issues in the digital economy. Learning objectives and outcomes are specific to each partner and challenge, and students will be supervised by a University of Waterloo faculty member and 1-2 representative from each partner. Projects will normally be undertaken in teams of 4-6 students, working virtually, on a schedule determined by the project scope.",

The seminar requirement can be fulfilled by attending the School's annual program. Consideration will be given (in special cases) to attend an alternate symposium if it is not possible to attend the School's annual program.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nBy the end of their 5th term of enrollment in the Vision Science program students must write a formal proposal and make a formal presentation of their proposed PhD thesis research to their advisory committee.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nThe Comprehensive Examination Milestone will be considered complete when students have successfully completed their Acceleration Qualifying Examination.\nPhD Thesis\nA primary requirement for the awarding of the PhD is the successful completion and defense of a thesis that contributes to knowledge about some aspect of vision and demonstrates proficiency in original and independent research.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Optometry and Vision Science website\nfile_upload",

        "details": "OD-Accelerated Master's Program in Vision Science\nFaculty\nFaculty of Science\nAcademic unit\nSchool of Optometry and Vision Science\nAccelerated program details\nThe School of Optometry and Vision Science offers an OD-Accelerated Master's Program for professional optometry students. This program provides an introduction to postgraduate study, academic enrichment and recognition of the contributions research for outstanding optometry students who might otherwise overlook the opportunity of graduate studies. The accelerated program provides a quicker route to the Master of Science (MSc) for outstanding students who will obtain graduate training, an increased scientific component along with the clinical training and a further specialization in an area of Vision Science.\nGeneral Principles of the OD-Accelerated Master's Program\nThe OD-Accelerated Master's Program is one in which the educational process leading through the Doctor of Optometry (OD) to the MSc degree is considered as a continuous unit. The accelerated program also provides the opportunity for mutual enrichment of both programs. The Vision Science background of the OD program serves as a solid precursor to research at the MSc level. The research at the MSc level broadens the application of the Vision Science component beyond that of the OD program and provides an increased scientific component to clinical training. This program provides an alternative scheduling of the requirements of both degrees to that used when the OD is considered a terminal degree.\nConditions\nThe following are general conditions that all OD-Accelerated Master's degree programs satisfy:\nnine terms of full-time enrolment at the undergraduate level in the OD program and at least two terms of full-time enrolment at the graduate level are mandatory;\nthe graduate program must include at least 4 graduate courses and a thesis.\nComplete additional program requirements including, but not limited to, a thesis proposal, seminar presentation, and seminar attendance.\nStudents in the OD-Accelerated Master's Program will fulfill the degree requirements of both the OD program and the MSc program.\nThe culmination of the accelerated program is the Master of Science degree; this will be achieved through the completion of a research thesis, 4 graduate courses (0.50 unit weight each), and all other program requirements.\nIdentification of a supervisor and provisional acceptance for the OD-Accelerated Master's Program may occur as early as the Winter term (second term) of the first year of the OD program. Formal acceptance and registration for the MSc component will occur during the third year of the OD program.\nThe OD-Accelerated Master's degree program must have the flexibility to satisfy the requirements of individual students; at the same time it must have coherence - each student's program must be focused on a well-defined area of specialization in Vision Science.\nStructure of the OD-Accelerated Master's Program\nAdmission requirements\nAdmission to the OD-Accelerated Master's degree program is restricted to students with a consistently good academic record in the OD program and who are granted \"provisional acceptance to the OD-Accelerated MSc Program\". The provisions to be fulfilled for acceptance to the OD-Accelerated Master's Program are satisfactory completion of the requirements for admission to the MSc program and a minimum cumulative average of 75% across their pre-optometry and Optometry programs. In granting admission to the OD-Accelerated Master's Program both the academic record in the OD program and in the pre-optometry program, and any research experience will be considered. Students must have a minimum 73-76% average within the OD program to be eligible for admission and would normally have an 85-89% standing in their pre-optometry program. Students must have completed their application to the OD-Accelerated Master's Program and be conditionally accepted into the program by the beginning of the 4th year. As in any program culminating in an MSc degree, a faculty supervisor is appointed on admission. Students are encouraged to consult faculty members regarding their research interests.\nCourse programs\nAlthough the supervisor advises students, all course selections and other academic administrative matters concerning each student are subject to the approval of the School's Graduate Studies Office and Undergraduate Studies Committee while enrolled in the OD program. Once enrolled as a graduate student in the MSc program, all course selections and other academic administrative matters concerning each student are subject to the approval of the School's Graduate Studies Office only.\nThe courses chosen by the student (with the advice of the supervisor and approval of Graduate Studies Office and Undergraduate Studies Committee) should form a coherent series which (together with the thesis) complete the requirements of the MSc degree.\nA minimum of 4 one-term (0.50 unit weight) graduate courses (600 level or equivalent) are required to complete the MSc degree requirements. 3 of these must be selected from the Vision Science Core Course Streams, with at least 1 course from Core Stream A – Scientific Methods (OPTOM 650 – OPTOM 669) and at least 1 course from Core Stream B – Vision Science (OPTOM 670 – OPTOM 689). Normally only 1 course may be an independent study course (OPTOM 608).\nDuring the OD program at least one 600 level course must be taken that will count for credit to the OD-Accelerated Master's degree. These courses are in addition to the normal academic program for the OD degree. Technically, it is necessary for students to register for these courses as \"extras\" to avoid them being counted towards the requirements of the OD degree. Advanced standing in these courses will be granted following acceptance to the graduate program. A student proceeding to an OD-Accelerated Master's degree will normally complete the balance of the 4 required graduate courses in the one or two terms following the final year of the OD program.\nOD-Accelerated Master's research terms\nIt is expected that most of the students proceeding to the MSc degree will engage in research during the spring academic term of the first and second years of the OD program. They are not required to register for these terms and they may be hired as associate/assistant researchers for the purposes of various research grants, without the restriction of student salaries. This combination can be attractive from the points of view of available research time, income generation for the student, and total research cost from a grant. Work done during the research terms may be included in the MSc thesis.\nThe spring academic terms are also the optimal time for students to take the required 600 level course for the OD-Accelerated Master's. Registration for a 600 level course requires that the student have adequate undergraduate preparation for the desired course, and they have received approval to enroll in the course from both the School's Graduate Studies Office and the Undergraduate Studies Committee.\nGranting of degrees\nThe OD degree will be granted at the normal time, i.e. at the Spring Convocation following the 4th year of the OD program. The OD-Accelerated Master's Program, however, culminates in the MSc. To complete the OD-Accelerated Master's Program, a minimum of two terms full-time enrolment in the MSc program is required after completion of the OD degree. It is expected that the OD-Accelerated Master's degree will be completed more quickly than the regular MSc program due to progress achieved in the OD-Accelerated Master's research terms. Additional time (i.e., more than two terms post-OD) may be required to complete the thesis or coursework.\nPostgraduate scholarships\nStudents in the OD-Accelerated Master's Program may apply for graduate scholarships at the same time as their colleagues in the regular graduate programs. They are also eligible for Optometry undergraduate scholarships during the OD-Accelerated Master's research terms.\nWithdrawal or failure\nStudents may remain in the OD-Accelerated Master's Program provided they maintain sufficiently high academic standards. The minimum is a cumulative 75% average (73 to 76% in undergraduate courses to the end of 4th year, 70% in graduate courses) and no conditional standing or undergraduate course failures.\nA student who fails to maintain this standard will be required to withdraw from the OD-Accelerated Master's degree program. In such a case, all courses taken up to the end of 4th year, including those originally intended to fulfill part of the MSc degree requirements, will be included on the student transcripts. Such students are still eligible to apply to the regular MSc program.\nIf a student maintains at least the minimum standard mentioned above, but decides to withdraw voluntarily from the OD-Accelerated Master's Program, all graduate courses taken, will be included on the student transcripts. Such a student will be allowed (at a later date) to apply to the regular MSc program. For these students, graduate courses completed during the OD degree may be applied to the regular MSc degree with approval of the School’s Graduate Studies Office.\nTransfer to the PhD program\nFollowing completion of the OD program, an OD-Accelerated Master's student will be eligible for transfer to the PhD program on the same basis as a regular MSc student.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Optometry and Vision Science website\nfile_upload",

Permission must also be granted by the department or program in which the courses are offered.\nThe program offers 3 non-traditional courses which will be managed as follows:\nPACS 621 Peace Research: an agreement between the student and the supervising faculty member about research expectations, length of paper, format, topic, types of sources that can be used, and anticipated outcomes is required. Students will be required to prepare a detailed proposal prior to registration in this course that will fully explain the proposed research as well as provide a short bibliography to ensure that adequate sources exist to successfully complete the research. Students will meet periodically with their instructor throughout the term to ensure that milestones are reached. Written work will be evaluated per normal academic criteria.\nPACS 625 Internship: students will be required to submit a petition outlining the details of the proposed internship such as place, position, cost, academic work expectations, security concerns, etc. Students will be expected to engage in substantial research on issues related to the host agency as part of the internship. While PACS has the agreement of over ten organizations who are interested in hosting interns, it is anticipated that internships will be negotiated to fit the unique long-term goals of each student. Host agencies will be expected to submit a reference evaluating the student intern at the end of the internship. Written work submitted by the student (evidence of research and reflective report) will be evaluated per normal academic criteria.\nPACS 626 Conflict Resolution Skills Training: this course offers an opportunity for students to take skills-training workshops. Program consent is required to ensure that workshops selected by students, plus the expected additional assigned academic work, are appropriate.\nStudents in the MPACS program may also choose to pursue the Graduate Specialization in Peace Integration.\nA Graduate Specialization is a University credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript but not on the diploma and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed a set of courses that together provide an in-depth study in the area of the Graduate Specialization. A student will only obtain the Graduate Specialization on their transcript if they have completed the requirements associated with the MPACS degree and the requirements associated with the Graduate Specialization.\nThe course requirements for the Graduate Specialization in Peace Integration are described below.\nStudents must complete the following courses:\nPACS 605 Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding\n1.50 units from the following list (note: each 0.50 unit/course must be from a different subject code/area):\nGGOV 610/PSCI 688/PACS 630 Governance of Global Economy\nGGOV 622 Complexity and Global Governance\nGGOV 630/PSCI 678/PACS 634 Security Ontology-Theory\nGGOV 631/PSCI 679/PACS 635 Security Governance: Actors, Institutions, and Issues\nGGOV 633 Managing Nuclear Risk\nGGOV 662/SOC 781 Global Development Governance\nINDEV 604/PACS 650 Sustainable Cities\nINDEV 605/PACS 651 Economics for Sustainable Development\nINDEV 608/PACS 652 Water and Security\nINDEV 609 Sustainability Concepts, Applications and Key Debates\nINDEV 613 Water, Human Security and Development\nGEMCC 602 Climate Change: Vulnerability and Adaptation\nGEMCC 622 Climate Change, Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction\nGEMCC 640 Climate Change Governance: From Global Treaties to Local Innovation\nHLTH 603 Health Systems and Policy\nHLTH 604 Health and the Environment (blended on-campus/online offering)\nHLTH 607 Social and Cultural Aspects of Public Health (blended on-campus/online offering)\nHLTH 614 Foundations of Program Evaluation\nHLTH 632 Health Economics and Public Health (online offering)\nHLTH 661 Geographic Information Systems and Public Health (online offering)\nHLTH 662 Global Health\n2.00 units of:\nPACS 601 Thinking Critically About Civil Society\nPACS 602 Reflective Peace Practice\nPACS 603 Engaging Communities in Social Change\nPACS 604 Conflict Analysis\nAt least 1.00 units of:\nPACS 610 Contemporary Nonviolent Movements\nPACS 611 Reconciliation\nPACS 612 Culture, Religion, and Peacebuilding\nPACS 620 Special Topics in Peace and Conflict Studies\nPACS 621 Peace Research\nPACS 625 Internship\nPACS 626 Conflict Resolution Skills Training\nCoursework option: Milestone requirements\nGraduate Studies Colloquium\nThe Colloquium will be completed towards the end of the student's program. All students will be required to present publicly, at a Colloquium of MPACS faculty, students and guests, one of the papers they have written for an MPACS course. Length will normally be 25-30 pages (7,500 words). Each student will consult with the professor for whom the original paper was written to identify the core issues to emphasize and the best methods to employ to present the paper. The presentation will be followed by a formal peer response and open discussion. In addition to presenting their own research paper, each student will be required to read and present an oral evaluation of one of the other research papers presented at a Colloquium.\nRelevant links\nPeace and Conflict Studies website\nMaster of Peace and Conflict Studies (MPACS) future students program page\nfile_upload",

Permission must also be granted by the department or program in which the courses are offered.\nThe program offers 3 non-traditional courses which will be managed as follows:\nPACS 621 Peace Research: an agreement between the student and the supervising faculty member about research expectations, length of paper, format, topic, types of sources that can be used, and anticipated outcomes is required. Students will be required to prepare a detailed proposal prior to registration in this course that will fully explain the proposed research as well as provide a short bibliography to ensure that adequate sources exist to successfully complete the research. Students will meet periodically with their instructor throughout the term to ensure that milestones are reached. Written work will be evaluated per normal academic criteria.\nPACS 625 Internship: students will be required to submit a petition outlining the details of the proposed internship such as place, position, cost, academic work expectations, security concerns, etc. Students will be expected to engage in substantial research on issues related to the host agency as part of the internship. While PACS has the agreement of over ten organizations who are interested in hosting interns, it is anticipated that internships will be negotiated to fit the unique long-term goals of each student. Host agencies will be expected to submit a reference evaluating the student intern at the end of the internship. Written work submitted by the student (evidence of research and reflective report) will be evaluated per normal academic criteria.\nPACS 626 Conflict Resolution Skills Training: this course offers an opportunity for students to take skills-training workshops. Program consent is required to ensure that workshops selected by students, plus the expected additional assigned academic work, are appropriate.\nStudents in the MPACS program may also choose to pursue the Graduate Specialization in Peace Integration.\nA Graduate Specialization is a University credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript but not on the diploma and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed a set of courses that together provide an in-depth study in the area of the Graduate Specialization. A student will only obtain the Graduate Specialization on their transcript if they have completed the requirements associated with the MPACS degree and the requirements associated with the Graduate Specialization.\nThe course requirements for the Graduate Specialization in Peace Integration are described below.\nStudents must complete the following courses:\nPACS 605 Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding\n1.50 units from the following list (note: each 0.50 unit/course must be from a different subject code/area):\nGGOV 610/PSCI 688/PACS 630 Governance of Global Economy\nGGOV 622 Complexity and Global Governance\nGGOV 630/PSCI 678/PACS 634 Security Ontology-Theory\nGGOV 631/PSCI 679/PACS 635 Security Governance: Actors, Institutions, and Issues\nGGOV 633 Managing Nuclear Risk\nGGOV 662/SOC 781 Global Development Governance\nINDEV 604/PACS 650 Sustainable Cities\nINDEV 605/PACS 651 Economics for Sustainable Development\nINDEV 608/PACS 652 Water and Security\nINDEV 609 Sustainability Concepts, Applications and Key Debates\nINDEV 613 Water, Human Security and Development\nGEMCC 602 Climate Change: Vulnerability and Adaptation\nGEMCC 622 Climate Change, Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction\nGEMCC 640 Climate Change Governance: From Global Treaties to Local Innovation\nHLTH 603 Health Systems and Policy\nHLTH 604 Health and the Environment (blended on-campus/online offering)\nHLTH 607 Social and Cultural Aspects of Public Health (blended on-campus/online offering)\nHLTH 614 Foundations of Program Evaluation\nHLTH 632 Health Economics and Public Health (online offering)\nHLTH 661 Geographic Information Systems and Public Health (online offering)\nHLTH 662 Global Health\n2.00 units of:\nPACS 601 Thinking Critically About Civil Society\nPACS 602 Reflective Peace Practice\nPACS 603 Engaging Communities in Social Change\nPACS 604 Conflict Analysis\nAt least 1.00 units of:\nPACS 610 Contemporary Nonviolent Movements\nPACS 611 Reconciliation\nPACS 612 Culture, Religion, and Peacebuilding\nPACS 620 Special Topics in Peace and Conflict Studies\nPACS 621 Peace Research\nPACS 625 Internship\nPACS 626 Conflict Resolution Skills Training\nCoursework option:",
            "Milestone requirements": "Graduate Studies Colloquium\nThe Colloquium will be completed towards the end of the student's program. All students will be required to present publicly, at a Colloquium of MPACS faculty, students and guests, one of the papers they have written for an MPACS course. Length will normally be 25-30 pages (7,500 words). Each student will consult with the professor for whom the original paper was written to identify the core issues to emphasize and the best methods to employ to present the paper. The presentation will be followed by a formal peer response and open discussion. In addition to presenting their own research paper, each student will be required to read and present an oral evaluation of one of the other research papers presented at a Colloquium.",

The main criterion for acceptance will be gaining knowledge in an area that is outside the background of the student but will benefit their research program. Graduate students and their Advisory Committee must ensure that the course selection reflects a graduate degree in Pharmacy.\nMilestone requirements\nGraduate Studies Seminar\nThis milestone requires students enrolled in the program to attend the School of Pharmacy Research Seminar Series continuously throughout their program. Attendance at 5 seminars each term will be the minimum required for full-time students. Attendance at 2 seminars each term will be the minimum required for part-time students.\nReasonable exceptions for not meeting minimum attendance in a term will be granted by the Graduate Officer in cases of illness, unavoidable TA or course conflict, and research conference attendance. Outside employment, experimental preparation, final thesis writing and vacation are not considered reasonable exceptions for attendance.\nThis milestone also requires students enrolled in the PhD in Pharmacy program to orally present their research within the Research Seminar Series or in rare and pre-approved circumstances at an acceptable alternative scientific forum. The milestone will be considered complete when the Graduate Officer has approved the setting (if not the Research Seminar Series) as a reasonable venue for scientific presentation and the presentation in either context has been completed.\nStudents who were admitted to the PhD in Pharmacy program prior to Fall 2014 (1149) and who have already presented at a major national or international conference or acceptable alternative scientific forum may receive approval of completion of this component of this milestone, and will be considered on a case by case basis.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Pharmacy program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nStudents with no previous studies at the PhD level must begin the comprehensive examination not later than the end of their fourth term of studies.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents must submit and defend a thesis, embodying the results of original research.\nThe third and fourth years of the student‘s program are devoted to research, writing, and defending the thesis. In addition to demonstrating the ability to carry out research and teaching at the highest intellectual level, our students will be able to communicate the fruits of that research to a much wider audience than simply those in their particular area of specialty. At the thesis defense, students are required to make a public presentation of their research, which is part of the Program‘s commitment to ensuring the public intelligibility of scholarship.\nOther requirements\nThesis Advisory Committee meetings: the thesis advisory committee must be formed during the student’s first term.\nThe thesis advisory committee must meet formally to report on the student’s progress, at least annually, according to the following schedule: 1) the first meeting of the thesis advisory committee meeting must be held by the end of the first term; 2) the thesis proposal examination should take place by the end of the second term and no later than the middle of the third term; 3) subsequent general meetings must be held at least annually.\nThe student must submit a written report following each thesis advisory committee meeting.\nRelevant links\nSchool of Pharmacy website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Pharmacy future students program page\nfile_upload",

The Advisor for Applied Philosophy and the supervisor will work with the student to find a suitable applied philosophy research project in the student's area of interest.\nThe faculty member supervising the Applied Research Placement may assign readings and assign papers, and may also require the taking or auditing of relevant courses if a student requires enhanced foundational knowledge of theory, methods, or topic area. The supervisor will also determine the basis for assigning the grade for the Applied Research Placement. The Applied Research Placement supervisor may, in consultation with the Graduate Officer, choose to have a second faculty member participate in the assessment of any assignment or component. Work which has been submitted for credit in a course may not be submitted for credit in an Applied Research Placement.\nTo be admitted to the thesis proposal stage, students must complete these courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and applied research placement) with an average of 83% and no mark lower than 75%.\nStudents are expected to complete their courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and applied research placement) during the first five terms of their doctoral studies. Students who do not complete this work within five terms may only continue in the program at the Department's discretion. The Department may choose to set a further deadline for the completion of outstanding coursework or the applied research placement on a case-by-case basis. Students who do not meet all such further deadlines may be required to withdraw from the program.\nIn a case where the failure to meet progression requirements are solely due to problems in completing the applied research placement that are judged not to be primarily the responsibility of the student, they may be permitted to transfer to the Philosophy PhD program.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nUpon completion of their courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and applied research placement), students are admitted to the thesis proposal stage. They should then undertake discussions with a member of the Department and invite that person to be supervisor of their doctoral thesis, and should consult with the Graduate Officer concerning the formation of their Thesis Committee. Students will then complete a dissertation prospectus. The project must involve the use of philosophical techniques or concepts to understand actual cases or substantial empirical or interdisciplinary work. The Thesis Committee examines the student about the prospectus as they see fit, though normally in an oral exam. The Committee may pass the proposal; pass it with revisions; or require the student to revise the proposal for re-examination. At the re-examination the Committee may pass the proposal; or they may reject the proposal and require the student to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nUpon successful defence of the dissertation prospectus, students proceed to the thesis stage. The dissertation project may take the form of a traditional monograph, or it may take the form of several scholarly papers on interrelated topics, or it may take the form of scholarly papers together with work of a different type. In the case of the last option, the scholarly work should form the major component of the project, and the final part may take another form: it could be one or several publications for the press (for example, one in-depth article or three op-ed pieces); it could be a policy recommendation; it could be a contribution to industry (for example, part of a corporate ethics code). In the latter case, the student may be examined on the entire dissertation project at the defense, but it is expected that most of the questioning and most of the decision will be based on discussion of the scholarly component. The PhD degree is awarded after the project has been successfully defended in a public meeting and the student has submitted the final approved version of their thesis to UWSpace.\nOther requirements\nTeaching preparation: PhD students will normally complete the Centre for Teaching Excellence (CTE), CTE's Fundamentals of University Teaching, course in their first year. Completion of this course is required before students are eligible to teach courses independently for the Department of Philosophy. The Department recommends that students who intend to pursue a career in university teaching also complete CTE's Certificate in University Teaching during their time in the program.\nTCPS 2 Tutorial Course on Research Ethics (CORE)\n: Students will normally complete the CORE human ethics training in their first two terms. They may be required to complete it before the start of a placement with a host as part of PHIL 699 Applied Research Placement. If a student’s placement does not require TCPS 2, the student is required, nonetheless, to complete TCPS 2 by the end of their fifth term.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Philosophy website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Applied Philosophy future students program page\nfile_upload",

            "Course requirements": "Students must complete the following courses:\nPHIL 680A/PHIL 680B Departmental Graduate Seminar.\nThe seminar is a graduate level survey course intended to acquaint students with a number of topics under active investigation in the philosophical literature in a specific area of philosophy.\n5 one-term Philosophy graduate courses (0.50 unit weight per course), at least 2 of which are PHIL 674 Graduate Courses.\nWith the approval of the Graduate Officer, a student may replace one Philosophy graduate course (0.50 unit weight) with a graduate course from another department.\n1 research area course (PHIL 698 Research Area Tutorials for PhD).\nThe intention is that each research area will prepare the student to make a research contribution in a particular area of philosophy.\nThe student selects a faculty supervisor for the Research Area in consultation with their pro tem advisor and the Graduate Officer. While it is possible to do an area in one of the traditional divisions of philosophy (e.g., Metaphysics, Ethics, Logic or History of Philosophy), it will normally be on a more specific topic (e.g., Theories of Meaning and Mental Content, Theories of Human Rights, Theories of Truth, Plato’s Later Dialogues).\nThe faculty member supervising a Research Area will determine the program for it, which normally should be designed to be completed by the student in two terms. In determining the assignments for the Research Area, the faculty member may assign readings and assign papers, and may also require the taking or auditing of relevant courses if a student requires enhanced foundational knowledge of theory, methods, or topic area. The faculty member will also determine the basis for assigning the grade for the Research Area. The Research Area supervisor may, in consultation with the Graduate Officer, choose to have a second faculty member participate in the assessment of any assignment or component. Work which has been submitted for credit in a course may not be submitted for credit in a Research Area.\nTo be admitted to the thesis proposal stage, students must complete these courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and research area) with an average of 83% and no mark lower than 75%.\nStudents are expected to complete their courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and research area) during the first five terms of their doctoral studies. Students who do not complete this work within five terms may only continue in the program at the Department's discretion. The Department may choose to set a further deadline for the completion of outstanding coursework or the research area on a case-by-case basis. Students who do not meet all such further deadlines may be required to withdraw from the program.",
            "Milestone requirements": "PhD Thesis Proposal\nUpon completion of their courses (i.e., seminar, courses, and research area), students are admitted to the thesis proposal stage. They should then undertake discussions with a member of the Department and invite that person to be supervisor of their doctoral thesis, and should consult with the Graduate Officer concerning the formation of their Thesis Committee. Students will then complete a dissertation prospectus. The Thesis Committee examines the student about the prospectus as they see fit, though normally in an oral exam. The Committee may pass the proposal; pass it with revisions; require the student to revise the proposal for re-examination. At the re-examination the Committee may pass the proposal; or they may reject the proposal and require the student to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nUpon successful defence of the dissertation prospectus, students proceed to the thesis stage. The PhD degree is awarded after the thesis has been successfully defended in a public meeting and the student has submitted the final approved version of their thesis to UWSpace.",
            "Other requirements": "Teaching preparation: PhD students will normally complete the Centre for Teaching Excellence (CTE), CTE's Fundamentals of University Teaching, course in their first year. Completion of this course is required before students are eligible to teach courses independently for the Department of Philosophy. The Department recommends that students who intend to pursue a career in university teaching also complete CTE's Certificate in University Teaching during their time in the program.",

If a student does not meet these minimum grade requirements, or receives a failing grade in any course, the student may be required to withdraw from the program.\nThe student's Advisory Committee may require additional courses dependent on the student's background.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the PhD in Physics program:\nCommittee composition: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements with the exception that two examiners must not be the student’s supervisor(s). At least one examiner must be a regular faculty member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. At least two (one for PhD students supervised by a Perimeter Institute faculty member) examiners must hold regular faculty appointments at University of Waterloo.\nIn addition to the University-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Physics program are also required to follow the requirements outlined below:\nThe examination will assess the student's knowledge of the fundamentals and applications of the physics closely related to the thesis topic.\nA student’s comprehensive exam includes both written and oral components. These components are evaluated by an examining committee constituted for a given student. The examining committee will consist of at least three expert examiners, in accordance with university guidelines. The nonvoting Chair will normally be the program Director or their designate. The Associate Director from the University of Guelph or his/her designate may attend the exam either as an expert examiner or a non-expert examiner.\nThe student’s advisory committee will meet formally with the student during the first year of the PhD program. From this meeting, a list of three areas of physics deemed necessary background for the thesis topic will result and be recorded on the Committee meeting form along with the names of three expert examiners. At the committee meeting, the committee members will specify the level of knowledge expected in each area (eg at the level of the original research literature, review articles or graduate level textbooks). Examiners are encouraged to give to the student explicit examples of references which illustrate the level and knowledge expected.\nOnce the exam date has been scheduled, each of the three expert members of the committee with knowledge of the designated areas, will be asked to set 3 exam questions, each requiring approximately 10 minutes to answer. Along with their questions, the expert examiners will also submit an outline of the answers they expect for their respective questions; this will not only ensure that the questions are of the right length but will also be of help to the non-expert committee member(s) during the exam. Sufficient collaboration should occur among expert examiners to avoid excessive duplication of exam questions.\nThe Chair of the exam (Director or his/her designate) will vet and approve the questions and may request edits to remove overlaps or improve the clarity of questions and/or solutions. All examiners will proofread the final exam. The oral exam is intended to be approximately 90 minutes long but may run longer, if necessary. All questions will normally be covered.\nThe student will have access to the exam in an examination room for up to two hours with a calculator and paper provided to them (if the student so desires) prior to the start of the formal oral examination period. No books or other aids are permitted.\nIn the oral portion of the exam, the student may choose the first question for which he/she will present a solution; the exam will then proceed in the established question order from question 1). Solutions to questions will be presented to the examination committee one at a time without interruption. The examination committee will ask questions and/or provide feedback only after the student has completed his/her presentation of a given question. The student will be assessed separately on the presentation and discussion components of each question and a combined grade will also be recorded by each examiner.\nThe candidate will leave the room while the committee discusses the grades given. The most recent report of the advisory committee and the student's grades in graduate courses will be available to the committee for its deliberations after the examination is finished. Discussion of the candidate's responses to individual questions is expected before arriving at a final recommendation on the outcome of the exam. The result is communicated verbally to the candidate once the decision has been made and is followed by written confirmation, usually within 24 hours.\nIn the case of a conditional pass, the conditions specified may be aimed at improving a weakness in understanding of one or more of the three areas of the exam.\nSince the oral portion of the exam immediately follows the written part and involves a presentation by the candidate of the written responses to questions, suspected violations of academic integrity during the written exam should be reported to the Chair of the exam who will normally allow the oral portion of the exam to proceed and the potential academic integrity violation will be vetted after the completion of the exam.\nPhD Thesis\nAn acceptable thesis on an advanced research topic must be submitted. The topic of the thesis and the quality of the research will be such as to merit publication in reputable scholarly media.\nAcceptance of the thesis requires satisfactory completion of a Final Oral Examination.\nOther requirements\nAdvisory Committee meetings: it is required that the student meet formally with their Advisory Committee within the first six months of registration and subsequently at least once per year. If the student receives more than one unsatisfactory evaluation from an Advisory Committee meeting, they may be required to withdraw from the program.\nThe PhD Advisory Committee must consist of at least four members, including:\nThe student’s supervisor(s); the primary supervisor acts as the Committee Chair.\nAt least one Committee member that is a regular faculty member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo. Note: This requirement does not apply for PhD students who are supervised by a Perimeter Institute faculty member with Sole-Supervisory Privilege Status (SSPS2).\nAt least two Committee members that are regular, adjunct, or cross-listed faculty members of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo or the Department of Physics as the University of Guelph.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Physics future students program page\nfile_upload",

At least one examiner must be a regular faculty member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. At least two (one for PhD students supervised by a Perimeter Institute faculty member) examiners must hold regular faculty appointments at University of Waterloo.\nIn addition to the University-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Physics - Quantum Information program are also required to follow the requirements outlined below:\nThe examination will assess the student's knowledge of the fundamentals and applications of the physics closely related to the thesis topic.\nA student’s comprehensive exam includes both written and oral components. These components are evaluated by an examining committee constituted for a given student. The examining committee will consist of at least three expert examiners, in accordance with university guidelines. The nonvoting Chair will normally be the program Director or their designate. The Associate Director from the University of Guelph or his/her designate may attend the exam either as an expert examiner or a non-expert examiner.\nThe student’s advisory committee will meet formally with the student during the first year of the PhD program. From this meeting, a list of three areas of physics deemed necessary background for the thesis topic will result and be recorded on the Committee meeting form along with the names of three expert examiners. At the committee meeting, the committee members will specify the level of knowledge expected in each area (eg at the level of the original research literature, review articles or graduate level textbooks). Examiners are encouraged to give to the student explicit examples of references which illustrate the level and knowledge expected.\nOnce the exam date has been scheduled, each of the three expert members of the committee with knowledge of the designated areas, will be asked to set 3 exam questions, each requiring approximately 10 minutes to answer. Along with their questions, the expert examiners will also submit an outline of the answers they expect for their respective questions; this will not only ensure that the questions are of the right length but will also be of help to the non-expert committee member(s) during the exam. Sufficient collaboration should occur among expert examiners to avoid excessive duplication of exam questions.\nThe Chair of the exam (Director or his/her designate) will vet and approve the questions and may request edits to remove overlaps or improve the clarity of questions and/or solutions. All examiners will proofread the final exam. The oral exam is intended to be approximately 90 minutes long but may run longer, if necessary. All questions will normally be covered.\nThe student will have access to the exam in an examination room for up to two hours with a calculator and paper provided to them (if the student so desires) prior to the start of the formal oral examination period. No books or other aids are permitted.\nIn the oral portion of the exam, the student may choose the first question for which he/she will present a solution; the exam will then proceed in the established question order from question 1). Solutions to questions will be presented to the examination committee one at a time without interruption. The examination committee will ask questions and/or provide feedback only after the student has completed his/her presentation of a given question. The student will be assessed separately on the presentation and discussion components of each question and a combined grade will also be recorded by each examiner.\nThe candidate will leave the room while the committee discusses the grades given. The most recent report of the advisory committee and the student's grades in graduate courses will be available to the committee for its deliberations after the examination is finished. Discussion of the candidate's responses to individual questions is expected before arriving at a final recommendation on the outcome of the exam.

Students entering directly into a PhD without completing an MA may be permitted to complete an MA during their PhD. If students have relevant academic background beyond a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent but have not completed the MA degree from the University of Waterloo in the Graduate Research Field in which they are completing their PhD, then the PhD course requirements can, when deemed appropriate, be determined in consultation with the student's advisor, the Area Head, and Associate Chair, Graduate Studies in Psychology prior to admission.\nStudents enrolled in the doctoral program must complete the Department's core requirements, statistics requirements (or credit granted for evidence of a strong undergraduate statistics background) and comprehensive breadth requirements as described within each Graduate Research Field’s course requirements below. Courses with a numeric grading basis must be taken to meet the core and statistics requirements unless departmental permission is provided to take a course with a Credit/No Credit grading basis. For the purposes of the breadth requirement the relevant areas are listed below. Whether a course meets a breadth requirement is determined by the Graduate Research Field. If a student is unclear about whether a course will meet their breadth requirements, then they should consult with their supervisor and area head before enrolling in the course.\nClinical Psychology\nCognitive Psychology\nCognitive Neuroscience\nDevelopmental Psychology\nIndustrial/Organizational Psychology\nQuantitative Methods\nSocial Psychology\nAll courses taken to meet degree requirements must be accepted for graduate credit by the Department of Psychology and no degree candidate can fulfil more than half of the minimum department course requirements with Credit/No Credit courses.\nCourse requirements are minimum requirements only. Students may be required to take additional courses depending on their previous academic background and Graduate Research Field.\nCourses from outside the Department of Psychology may also be considered. Departmental permission is required. Note: When selecting a course from outside of the Department of Psychology, students should check with their advisor about its suitability.\nTransfer credits may also be considered. The acceptance of transfer credits from prior registration at another university will be determined in individual cases by the Associate Dean (Graduate Studies) of the Faculty at the time of admission to the program. Transfer credits must be \"unused\" credits (i.e., they must not have been credited towards an earlier acquired degree or other academic credential). Transfer credits must be specified in writing at the time of departmental recommendation for admission. A minimum of 70% (University of Waterloo converted grade) is required for transfer credit.\nCourses from outside the Department of Psychology and transfer credits can usually count for no more than 2 one-term credits toward breadth requirements.\nUse of a course not listed in the course requirements below to meet a degree requirement and other course substitutions are permitted but require departmental permission. Students should confirm the appropriateness of the course substitution with their advisor and have it approved by the Area head, and Associate Chair, Graduate Studies in Psychology.\nStudents pursuing the\nClinical Psychology\nGraduate Research Field must complete the following courses contingent upon the student’s previous academic background.\nIf a student enters the PhD with only a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, then the student is required to meet the course requirements beginning Year One below.\nIf a student enters the PhD program having completed the MA in Psychology degree with a Clinical Psychology Graduate Research Field from the University of Waterloo, then the student is required to meet the course requirements beginning Year Three below in addition to completing any courses listed in Year One and Year Two not already completed. By the end of the PhD, students need to have completed all requirements from Year One to Year Six below or approved substitutes when courses completed during both the MA and PhD are considered. The courses are listed below in a typical sequence. Individual student’s course sequences may vary, for example, based on course availability.\n2 statistics courses one of which must be PSYCH 630 Multiple Regression from the following list or an approved substitute:\nPSYCH 630 Advanced Analysis of Variance\nPSYCH 632 Multiple Regression\nPSYCH 640 Special Topics in Psychology (on departmentally approved topics)\nPSYCH 800 Psychometric Theory & Structural Equation Modeling\nPSYCH 801 Advanced Structural Equation Modeling\nPSYCH 803 Meta-Analysis\nPSYCH 804 Multi-Level Modeling Applications in Psychology\n4 breadth courses from other graduate research fields outside of Clinical Psychology (e.g., not from the list of core, clinical practica, or research\nClinical Psychology courses below) or an approved substitute.

Students must enroll in the program full-time, be available for classes and regular on-campus consultation for at least the first two calendar years, and complete a minimum of six terms beyond the Master of Arts (MA). Students are expected to proceed through the program in a timely fashion. Normally, students must complete the course work and finish their proposal in the first year; comprehensive exams in the second year; and the dissertation project in the third and fourth years. The responsibilities of the supervisor and the Supervisory Committee notwithstanding, the candidate is responsible for ensuring that program requirements and deadlines are met in a timely fashion.\nAdditional program information\nDrawing on the combined resources of the Department of Religion and Culture at Wilfrid Laurier University and the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Waterloo, the Laurier-Waterloo PhD in Religious Studies offers a concentration in the religious diversity of North America.\nGraduate research fields\nReligious Diversity in North America\nAdmission requirements: Minimum requirements\nOnly graduates of accredited universities and colleges are eligible for admission.\nStudents apply to the joint program, designating one of the two universities as the preferred home institution. A student may be offered admission to the partner institution if the Joint Committee deems this choice more appropriate because of the student’s interests or the availability of suitable supervisors. Applications are considered by the Joint Committee, and recommendations for admission or rejection are made by the Director to the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies at the proposed home university. Students are governed by the rules of the university in which they are registered, and their degree is granted by that same university; however, students may use faculty and library resources at both universities.\nStudents must normally have a Master's degree or its equivalent in Religious Studies or a closely allied field with an 80% overall standing. Completion of a Master’s thesis is strongly preferred.\nIf the MA is in an allied field, the candidate must have a minimum of 10 one-term (half-credit) courses, or their equivalent, in the academic study of religion.\nStudents lacking the necessary qualifications may be required to complete additional qualifying work to establish academic eligibility to apply for the program. Students allowed to transfer from other doctoral programs must meet all of the degree requirements (or their equivalent, as determined by the Joint Committee); normally, credit for doctoral level work done elsewhere is not transferrable.\nStudents' Supervisory Committees normally consist of three members drawn from the University of Waterloo Department of Religious Studies and/or the Wilfrid Laurier University Department of Religion and Culture. One of the three committee members is the supervisor, who must be at the student's home institution. Such committees are appointed within the student's first year in the program after consultation with the student.

Students are required to take RS 700 Religious Diversity in North America and RS 710 Approaches to the Study of Religion in North America, as well as 2 electives to be approved by the Graduate Officer.\nDepending on a student’s goals and admission assessment, additional course work may be required.\nStudents must achieve at least a 75% in each course.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Language Requirement\nStudents must demonstrate knowledge of a second language relevant to the field and/or the dissertation. Whether this knowledge is reading or speaking knowledge (or both) depends on the nature of the proposed research. If the topic of the dissertation makes knowledge of a third language essential, the candidate must demonstrate competence in this language as well. Students are not permitted to begin their dissertation until all language requirements are met.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nThe proposal is a written document outlining the dissertation project. The proposal must be formally accepted by both the student’s Supervisory Committee and the Joint Committee before proceeding to the comprehensive examinations and dissertation project. Subsequent, substantive changes in the proposal must be approved by the Supervisory Committee and the Program Director.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I and PhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the Faculty of Arts Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements with the exception that in the Faculty of Arts, the Graduate Chair can approve the committee for comprehensive examinations.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Religious Studies program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nStudents must complete 2 examinations: (a) the general exam is to ensure breadth and to assess competence in the study of religion; (b) the field exam is to focus an area of specialization and to determine readiness for the dissertation project. Each examination, based on a bibliography constructed by the faculty in consultation with the student, has a written and an oral component. A candidate has only two opportunities to complete each of the examinations successfully. These examinations should take place by the end of the candidate’s second year in the program. To be permitted to take the examinations at a later time, a candidate must petition the Director for an extension. Extensions are normally granted only once and then, only for one term.\nPhD Thesis\nDissertation Project: the dissertation project consists of three required, closely related parts: the dissertation, the public presentation, and the dissertation defense. Students must pass all three parts. Evaluations, carried out by the Supervisory Committee, take into consideration the mastery of both style and content.\nDoctoral Dissertation: the doctoral dissertation is a piece of research (approximately 50,000-90,000 words in length) aimed at making an original contribution to the study of religion. The dissertation must be crafted for publication as a book, although actual publication is not a degree requirement. This way of fulfilling the dissertation requirement is a distinctive feature of the program, and guidelines are available from the Director. The dissertation is prepared in consultation with the Supervisory Committee, which includes the candidate's supervisor acting as chair, along with two other faculty members, one of whom may be a member of a non-religious studies department.\nPublic Presentation: the public presentation is a second distinctive feature of the program. The presentation must be accessible to the public, open to questioning and debate, and subject to faculty evaluation. This presentation may take various formats and must demonstrate the candidate's ability to make the results of research publicly intelligible and engaging for a diverse, educated but non-specialist audience. The public presentation is held in a venue and at a time different from that of the dissertation defense. Holding it in an off-campus location is preferable. Evaluation is on a pass/fail basis, and a pass is required to complete the degree. Evaluation of such presentations is by the Supervisory Committee on the basis of a set of criteria available from the Program Director. A candidate who fails may attempt the presentation only one additional time.\nThesis Defense: the dissertation defense, which is distinct from the public presentation, is an oral review and evaluation of the dissertation. Prior to the defense, an Examining Committee is established. It includes the Supervisory Committee plus an internal examiner from another department at either university. A chair (from the university in which the student is registered) and an external examiner (from another university) are appointed by the appropriate Associate Provost, Graduate Studies. The Supervisory Committee recommends external examiners to the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies. The decision of the Examining Committee is based on the dissertation and the candidate's ability to defend it orally.

Normally, course work must be completed by the end of the fourth term in the PhD program.\nNote: coursework beyond these minima may be required at the discretion of the Associate Chair, Graduate Affairs. If further coursework is required, the student will be notified in writing at the time of entry into the program. Additional coursework may be required if the student's MA preparation is not the equivalent of that required for the MA degree in Sociology at the University of Waterloo. Students whose area of specialization and/or thesis requires familiarity with a subject not normally given in the Department of Sociology are encouraged to undertake additional work in the appropriate department.\nIn order to complete a course satisfactorily, students must complete all course requirements as specified by the instructor and receive a minimum grade of 75%.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Professional Development Seminar\nThe Professional Development Seminar milestone is required of all PhD candidates. In this seminar, faculty members provide information on topics relevant to PhD students, including scholarship applications, conference presentations, choosing a supervisor, socialization into the discipline, job applications, and academic publishing.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I and PhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted exceptions that are specific to the Faculty of Arts Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements with the exception that in the Faculty of Arts, the Graduate Chair can approve the committee for comprehensive examinations.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Sociology program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nOnce a student chooses a dissertation topic, they select a faculty member who is willing to supervise the dissertation.\nBefore submitting a dissertation proposal, the student must pass 2 comprehensive examinations in substantive areas, related to the Department's PhD \"fields\" listed below. Students may take 2 comprehensives in the same field. In each comprehensive, students are expected to demonstrate a familiarity with the theoretical and methodological approaches germane to that substantive area.\nCrime, Law, and Security\nKnowledge, Education, and Digital Culture\nMigration, Borders, and Transnationalism\nSocial Inequality and Public Policy\nNormally, students must complete their 1st comprehensive examination by the end of their fourth term in the program.\nNormally, students must complete their 2nd comprehensive examination by the end of their fifth term in the program.\nStudents may take comprehensives in one of two formats:\ni) a six-hour written examination; or\nii) a take-home examination with an oral defence.\nThe format will be decided in consultation with the student’s Comprehensive Examining Committee.\nPhD Thesis Proposal\nThe candidate must submit a proposal for the PhD dissertation, normally no later than the end of the eighth term. The proposal should contain a detailed statement of the research problem and its significance for a body of sociological theory, a precise account of the methodology or research techniques to be employed, plus a detailed outline of the proposed data analysis. The dissertation proposal will be circulated and defended before the student's Dissertation Committee but need not include the internal/external examiner.\nPhD Thesis\nPhD Dissertation Committee: a Dissertation Committee consists of four members: the supervisor, two members of the Department, and a fourth faculty member from outside the Department of Sociology but within the University who will serve as the internal/external examiner. Committee members are chosen by the student and supervisor in consultation. The internal/external examiner may be chosen when the committee is originally formed or added later, at the discretion of the student and the supervisor. It is possible to have a faculty member from another university serve as a member of the Dissertation Committee, subject to the approval of the supervisor, the Associate Chair, Graduate Affairs and the Associate Provost, Graduate Studies.\nPhD Oral Defence: once the dissertation is completed, there is an oral defence. The Examination Committee consists of the Dissertation Committee and a senior examiner from another university. A copy of the dissertation is retained in the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies Office and is available for inspection by Sociology and Legal Studies faculty and graduate students prior to the oral examination.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Sociology and Legal Studies website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Sociology future students program page\nfile_upload",

The purpose of this requirement is to provide students with an opportunity to improve their presentation skills. Each seminar should be attended by one, or preferably two, departmental faculty members.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nThe PhD Comprehensive Examination is divided into two stages: Stage I and Stage II. Students must complete Stage I before they can proceed to Stage II.\nThe Stage I requirement consists of courses in the “breadth requirement” and ACTSC 900 PhD Research Skills. The breadth requirement ensures that students have sufficient breadth of knowledge to undertake research at the PhD level.\nThe Stage II requirement, also referred to as the thesis proposal defense, is a diagnostic oral examination, the purpose of which is to test a student's preparedness to undertake thesis research in their specific field.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination I\nBy the end of their third term, students are required to (a) take at least 5 graduate level courses including their 900-level course requirements, (b) complete their required breadth requirements (see Table 1 above), and (c) ACTSC 900.\nStudents must achieve a grade of at least 75% in each breadth requirement course. Topics courses will be assigned to the appropriate category by the Graduate Officer.\nThe Graduate Officer may require students to take additional courses beyond the minimum number of courses noted above in the offer letter to the student (i.e., six courses for PhD students with a Masters, or nine courses for PhD students without a Masters).\nStudents must take ACTSC 900 that requires students to prepare a portfolio and undertake an oral exam by the end of their third term. Each student will be examined by the instructor and a ACTSC 900 committee, which includes the supervisor(s) and at least two other departmental Faculty members. This committee will evaluate the student according to a common grading scheme and all grades in the class will be moderated by the instructor to ensure consistency across committees. If the committee and instructor determine that the student has not reached the required standard for a passing grade, then they will prepare detailed comments on the weaknesses that need to be addressed in the portfolio and the oral exam. The student will then address these issues, resubmit the portfolio and retake the oral exam by the end of the following term. If the student fails the course for a second time, they will be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer or the Graduate Operations Committee in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nSubmit a written thesis proposal to the committee prior to the examination and present it during the comprehensive (Stage II) examination. The thesis proposal is orally presented to the public, followed by questioning from the student's Stage II Committee and any other members of the university community who may be present.\nThe Stage II Comprehensive Examination Committee consists of the supervisor(s) and at least two additional faculty members from the Department. The composition of the Stage II Committee must be approved by the Graduate Operations Committee, and the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies will act as a neutral chair of the Committee of examiners, or will appoint a faculty member to serve in that capacity.\nPhD Thesis\nThe PhD thesis and thesis examination are the culmination of the candidate's research efforts as a graduate student.\nThe examination is divided into two stages:\nOptional Departmental Thesis Presentation\nUniversity Thesis Defense\nDepartmental Thesis Presentation: PhD students are encouraged to present the results of their research before interested members of the department. This departmental thesis presentation is intended to fulfil several purposes. Students have an opportunity to practice their presentation skills and to gain valuable experience in answering questions about their work in a public setting. As well, faculty and graduate students who are interested in the thesis topic are provided with an overview of the student's research prior to the actual thesis examination.\nPhD Thesis Examination: the student shall defend the thesis in an oral examination before an Examining Committee, which shall consist of the supervisor(s), two faculty members in the Department, one faculty member from outside the Department, and an external examiner familiar with the student's research field. The Committee is approved by the Faculty Graduate Operations Committee.\nStudents must submit the PhD thesis to\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs (GSPA)\nafter it has been accepted by the Department and Faculty.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Statistics and Actuarial Science website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Actuarial Science future students program page\nfile_upload",

This committee will evaluate the student according to a common grading scheme and all grades in the class will be moderated by the instructor to ensure consistency across committees. If the committee and instructor determine that the student has not reached the required standard for a passing grade, then they will prepare detailed comments on the weaknesses that need to be addressed in the portfolio and the oral exam. The student will then address these issues, resubmit the portfolio and retake the oral exam by the end of the following term. If the student fails the course for a second time, then they will be required to withdraw from the program.\nPhD Comprehensive Examination II\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the Faculty of Mathematics Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nCommittee: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements. Note: The Faculty of Mathematics wishes to use the option to have the committee approved by a delegate of the Associate Dean, namely by the Graduate Officer or the Graduate Operations Committee in the home department of the student.\nWho Chairs an examination: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: In the Faculty of Mathematics, when a student needs to submit a written document to their comprehensive examination committee prior to the examination, they are required to sign an acknowledgement form affirming their work does not violate the University policy on Academic Integrity. Students are also encouraged to use a\nplagiarism detection software and include its report with the submission of their written document. Furthermore, the comprehensive examination committee may require the student to use such software and include the report it generated with the submission of their written component.\nIn addition to the University-level and Faculty-level PhD Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements, students in the PhD in Statistics program are also required to meet the following requirements:\nSubmit a written thesis proposal to the committee prior to the examination and present it during the comprehensive (Stage II) examination. The thesis proposal is orally presented to the public, followed by questioning from the student's Stage II Committee and any other members of the university community who may be present.\nThe Stage II Comprehensive Examination Committee consists of the supervisor(s) and at least two additional faculty members from the Department. The composition of the Stage II Committee must be approved by the Graduate Operations Committee, and the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies will act as a neutral chair of the Committee of examiners, or will appoint a faculty member to serve in that capacity.\nPhD Thesis\nThe PhD thesis and thesis examination are the culmination of the candidate's research efforts as a graduate student.\nThe examination is divided into two stages:\nOptional Departmental Thesis Presentation\nUniversity Thesis Defense\nDepartmental Thesis Presentation: PhD students are encouraged to present the results of their research before interested members of the department. This departmental thesis presentation is intended to fulfil several purposes. Students have an opportunity to practice their presentation skills and to gain valuable experience in answering questions about their work in a public setting. As well, faculty and graduate students who are interested in the thesis topic are provided with an overview of the student's research prior to the actual thesis examination.\nPhD Thesis Examination: the student shall defend the thesis in an oral examination before an Examining Committee, which shall consist of the supervisor(s), two faculty members in the Department, one faculty member from outside the Department, and an external examiner familiar with the student's research field. The Committee is approved by the Faculty Graduate Operations Committee.\nStudents must submit the PhD thesis to\nGraduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs (GSPA)\nafter it has been accepted by the Department and Faculty.\nRelevant links\nDepartment of Statistics and Actuarial Science website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Statistics - Biostatistics future students program page\nfile_upload",

Transfer from a MASc program to a PhD program will normally be considered if an applicant:\nHas an excellent undergraduate record.\nHas obtained a grade average of at least 80% in courses that have been taken for graduate credit.\nHas developed a clearly defined research program that seems likely to satisfy the research proposal component of the PhD comprehensive examination and has demonstrated an aptitude for research.\nPresents objective evidence of adequate English language skills which should enable the candidate to write a thesis and to communicate orally.\nIs not beyond the fourth academic term of a MASc program.\nEnglish language proficiency (ELP)\n(if applicable)\nAdmission requirements: Application materials\nRésumé\nSupplementary information form\nTranscript(s)\nAdmission requirements: References\nNumber of references: 3\nType of references: 2 from academic sources that are able to comment upon academic preparation and research ability\nDegree requirements\nStudents must complete the course and milestone requirements listed below in addition to the\nGraduate Academic Integrity Module (Graduate AIM)\n.\nCourse requirements\nPhD candidates possessing a Master's degree in an appropriate discipline are required to successfully complete 3 graduate courses (0.50 unit weight per course) at the 600 or 700 level satisfying the following criteria:\nAt least 1 course from the Systems Design Engineering core methods course list.\nA maximum of 1 course may be taken from outside the Faculty of Engineering but must be from the Faculties of Mathematics, Health, or Science.\nSystems Design Engineering core methods courses:\nSYDE 600 Systems Theory, Models, Research & Design\nSYDE 620 Fundamentals of Continuous System Models\nSYDE 631 Time Series Modelling\nSYDE 640 Experimental Design\nSYDE 675 Pattern Recognition\nThe Department may require individual candidates to take more than 3 courses. In every case, a graduate course program is established by the supervisor(s) in consultation with the student, and is subject to the approval of the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies. Candidates may also be required to take additional courses as a result of a comprehensive examination. Students pursuing one of the program's Graduate Research Fields, should inform their supervisor(s) of their chosen field(s) to ensure appropriate course selection.\nCandidates admitted to the PhD program who do not possess a relevant Master's degree, or have transferred directly to the PhD program without a Master's degree, are required to complete a minimum of 7 graduate courses (0.50 unit weight per course) satisfying the following criteria:\nAt least 5 courses from the Faculty of Engineering at the 600 or 700 levels.\nAt least 2 courses from Systems Design Engineering.\nAt least 1 course from the Systems Design Engineering core methods courses list.\nA maximum of 2 courses may be taken from outside the Faculty of Engineering but must be from the Faculties of Mathematics, Health, Environment, and/or Science.\nCandidates holding a Master’s degree in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo do not need to take a course from the Systems Design Engineering core methods course list. Instead they can take any graduate course from Systems Design Engineering.\nThe Faculty of Engineering requires that no more than one-half of the courses used for credit towards a graduate degree may be taught by the candidate's supervisor(s). In the case of co-supervision in small research groups, it may be necessary to relax this rule, but the student's file must contain a statement of formal approval from the Department and endorsement from the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research in the Faculty of Engineering.\nMilestone requirements\nPhD Comprehensive Examination\nStudents are required to meet the University-level PhD\nComprehensive Examination\nminimum requirements, with certain noted differences that are specific to the\nFaculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements\n:\nComprehensive examination purpose: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nTiming: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering completion timelines whereby students shall complete their comprehensive examination before the end of their 4th term or 6th term in cases where the student is admitted to the PhD program without a completed Master’s degree.\nCommittee: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering committee composition guidelines which differ from the University-level minimum requirements in both number of committee members and committee makeup.\nWho Chairs an examination: Students must follow the Faculty of Engineering Chair guidelines whereby the Chair is normally selected from outside of the student’s home department.\nFormat / Content: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements but with additional information provided in the Faculty of Engineering Comprehensive Examination minimum requirements.\nAcademic integrity: Consistent with University-level minimum requirements.\nPhD Seminar\nStudents are required to present a research seminar on their thesis at the Systems Design Engineering Graduate Colloquium or at a publicly attended seminar administered by their supervisor and advertised by the Department. Members of the Comprehensive Examining Committee should be invited to attend the seminar.\nSeminar Attendance\nStudents are required to attend an average of four University of Waterloo research seminars per full-time term and two per part-time term. It is the student’s responsibility to attach a list of seminars attended to their activity report.\nTo earn the seminar attendance milestone, the Department records should show that the number of seminars a student has attended is, at least, four times the number of terms the student has been registered as a full-time student in the Department.\nAnnual Progress Meeting with Advisory Committee I and Annual Progress Meeting with Advisory Committee II\nIn the period between their comprehensive examination and their thesis defense, each PhD candidate will meet with their approved Advisory Committee on an annual basis, usually within one month of the anniversary of their comprehensive examination. This meeting is an annual milestone that must be met in order to continue in the program.\nThe meeting will last no longer than one and a half hours.\nThe meeting will consist of:\nA presentation by the candidate,\nan examination and discussion with their committee members, and\ncommittee deliberations.\nThe outcome of each meeting will be a recommendation from the committee in one of the following three categories:\nCategory 1: candidate is making good progress and should continue with their plans.\nCategory 2: candidate has made sufficient progress and must take action to improve or respond to recommendations by the committee.\nCategory 3: candidate has made insufficient progress and remedial action is required within four months.\nIn the case, of a category 3 recommendation, the committee shall meet within one month of the deadline to make a recommendation on whether the candidate has made sufficient progress or should be Required to Withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nStudents may choose to pursue up to 2 of the following Graduate Research Fields:\nBiomedical Engineering\nHuman Factors and Ergonomics\nMachine Learning and Intelligence\nMechatronic and Physical Systems\nModelling, Simulation and Systems Theory\nOptimization and Decision Making\nSocietal and Environmental Systems\nVision, Image and Signal Processing\nA Graduate Research Field is a University credential that is recognized on the student’s transcript and is intended to reflect that a student has successfully completed research concentrated in the area of the Graduate Research Field. The Department, represented by the student’s supervisor and examining committee, must assess whether a student’s completed research warrants the field designation at the time of degree completion. To obtain the Graduate Research Field designation, a student must also complete the requirements associated with the PhD degree. Students can choose to pursue a maximum of 2 Graduate Research Field designations (1 methodology field and 1 application field) for their degree.\nCandidates are expected to maintain continuous registration until the thesis is submitted to Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Under exceptional circumstances, inactive terms or a leave of absence may be requested for a prior specified period with departmental approval. The role of a supervisor is to assist a candidate in establishing a research problem with an appropriate scope, to suggest alternative general approaches to the solution of a problem and to provide general advice on the structure and content of a thesis. It is imperative that the engineering code of ethics be strictly observed in the supervisor-candidate relationship.\nThe PhD degree in the Faculty of Engineering is awarded to a candidate who has successfully completed a program of advanced study and conducted original research. The program of research and its findings must be presented in the form of a thesis and submitted to the University for public examination prior to its oral defence.\nBefore the thesis is submitted for public examination, the candidate must submit a graphical abstract for their thesis to the Department. Guidelines for the graphical abstract are available from the Department.\nThe writer of a thesis must demonstrate a critical awareness and understanding of the literature in the research field, exhibit a capability of defining original and useful research problems and a capability of independent thought in solving a research problem. An ability to communicate research results verbally and in writing must be shown. The University of Waterloo allows students to submit theses in English or in French, the latter being governed by certain important constraints. The principles governing the submission of theses in French are specified in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. The oral examination of a thesis will assess the ability of a candidate to communicate orally the results of the research and to defend the contents of the thesis.\nOriginality in a thesis may be reflected in a number of ways. A candidate may have posed and solved an important new problem or have formulated an existing problem in a novel and useful way. A candidate may offer new and significant insights into problems examined previously by other researchers. Replications of previous investigations may be acceptable if, and only if, they incorporate [significantly new] elements in the design or execution of an experiment.\nObjective criteria describing what is meant by a significant contribution to knowledge are difficult to specify. One way of gauging a candidate's contribution is to consider the extent to which parts of the thesis might be published in peer-reviewed technical journals with an international stature or as a monograph by an acceptable publisher. The ultimate test of the acceptability of a thesis is the ability of a candidate to satisfy, through an oral examination, to a University-appointed committee of research specialists in the general field of study, that a significant research contribution has been made and communicated adequately.\nRelevant links\nSystems Design Engineering website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Systems Design Engineering future students program page\nfile_upload",

This meeting is an annual milestone that must be met in order to continue in the program.\nThe meeting will last no longer than one and a half hours.\nThe meeting will consist of:\nA presentation by the candidate,\nan examination and discussion with their committee members, and\ncommittee deliberations.\nThe outcome of each meeting will be a recommendation from the committee in one of the following three categories:\nCategory 1: candidate is making good progress and should continue with their plans.\nCategory 2: candidate has made sufficient progress and must take action to improve or respond to recommendations by the committee.\nCategory 3: candidate has made insufficient progress and remedial action is required within four months.\nIn the case, of a category 3 recommendation, the committee shall meet within one month of the deadline to make a recommendation on whether the candidate has made sufficient progress or should be Required to Withdraw from the program.\nPhD Thesis\nCandidates are expected to maintain continuous registration until the thesis is submitted to Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Under exceptional circumstances, inactive terms or a leave of absence may be requested for a prior specified period with departmental approval. The role of a supervisor is to assist a candidate in establishing a research problem with an appropriate scope, to suggest alternative general approaches to the solution of a problem and to provide general advice on the structure and content of a thesis. It is imperative that the engineering code of ethics be strictly observed in the supervisor-candidate relationship.\nThe PhD degree in the Faculty of Engineering is awarded to a candidate who has successfully completed a program of advanced study and conducted original research. The program of research must be applicable to Systems Design Engineering and Aeronautics and its findings must be presented in the form of a thesis and submitted to the University for public examination prior to its oral defence.\nBefore the thesis is submitted for public examination, the candidate must submit a graphical abstract for their thesis to the Department. Guidelines for the graphical abstract are available from the Department.\nThe writer of a thesis must demonstrate a critical awareness and understanding of the literature in the research field, exhibit a capability of defining original and useful research problems and a capability of independent thought in solving a research problem. An ability to communicate research results verbally and in writing must be shown. The University of Waterloo allows students to submit theses in English or in French, the latter being governed by certain important constraints. The principles governing the submission of theses in French are specified in the Graduate Studies Academic Calendar. The oral examination of a thesis will assess the ability of a candidate to communicate orally the results of the research and to defend the contents of the thesis.\nOriginality in a thesis may be reflected in a number of ways. A candidate may have posed and solved an important new problem or have formulated an existing problem in a novel and useful way. A candidate may offer new and significant insights into problems examined previously by other researchers. Replications of previous investigations may be acceptable if, and only if, they incorporate [significantly new] elements in the design or execution of an experiment.\nObjective criteria describing what is meant by a significant contribution to knowledge are difficult to specify. One way of gauging a candidate's contribution is to consider the extent to which parts of the thesis might be published in peer-reviewed technical journals with an international stature or as a monograph by an acceptable publisher. The ultimate test of the acceptability of a thesis is the ability of a candidate to satisfy, through an oral examination, to a University-appointed committee of research specialists in the general field of study, that a significant research contribution has been made and communicated adequately.\nRelevant links\nSystems Design Engineering website\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Systems Design Engineering - Aeronautics future students program page\nfile_upload",

A thesis is approximately 120 pages in length and is considered to be the equivalent of 50% of the student's program. It consists of the following stages:\nPreliminary Stage: consulting with the Program Director and faculty advisor to identify a research area and select a thesis supervisor. This stage should be completed by early in the second term of full time studies.\nThesis Proposal: writing a proposal under the guidance of the thesis supervisor, for approval by the Graduate Studies Committee. Two readers will be chosen once the proposal has been accepted. This stage should be completed by the end of the second term of full time studies.\nThesis Research: thesis research begins during the formulation of the thesis proposal. Some of the research can often be integrated into coursework. A significant period of focused research will also be required. Students whose research requires specific language skills (e.g. Hebrew, Greek) will be required to demonstrate competency in that language.\nThesis Writing: writing the thesis under the direction of the thesis supervisor normally occurs when coursework is complete.\nThesis Defence: when the thesis supervisor confirms that the thesis is ready for defence, it will be sent to the two readers for their assessment. If they agree that it is ready for defence a date for the defence will be confirmed. The defence will be chaired by the Program Director and involve the student, thesis supervisor and the two readers. It will be open to other faculty and students.\nThesis Completion: after the thesis has been successfully defended it will be revised or corrected, approved by the thesis supervisor, and then filed with the College and University in the form and according to procedures in force at that time. Students will be responsible for the costs of this stage.\nCoursework option: Course requirements\nCoursework option:\nStudents must complete 16 graduate-level one-term courses (0.50 unit weight) including 4 core courses.\nStudents must maintain a 75% average.\nCore courses (must be taken at CGUC):\nTS 600 Thinking Theologically\nTS 610 Studying the Old Testament\nTS 611 Studying the New Testament\nTS 640 The Mennonite Tradition in Historical Context\nCourses taken in other departments: at least 50% of the courses required for the degree must be taken in the Theological Studies program.

In consultation with the professor for whom the original paper was written, the student will make any revisions required to qualify the paper as a research paper. Length will normally be 25-30 pages (7,500 words). The paper will be presented and defended in the research seminar. After the presentation in the research seminar the student will make revisions to the paper under the supervision of the professor. The research paper will then be filed with the Department.\nThe research seminar is a colloquium chaired by the Program Director in which research papers are presented to Theological Studies faculty and graduate students. In addition to presenting their own research paper they will be expected to read and present an oral evaluation of one of the other research papers presented in the seminar.\nRelevant links\nTheological Studies website\nMaster of Theological Studies (MTS) future students program page\nfile_upload",

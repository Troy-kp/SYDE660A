# Program Loading Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The web interface was only showing 3 engineering programs instead of all 6, and specializations were incomplete. This was caused by two main issues:

### 1. Unified Format File Priority
- The system was loading from `engineering_programs_unified.json` which only contained 3 programs (Systems Design, Chemical, ECE)
- This file had outdated/incomplete data and was taking priority over the enhanced individual JSON files

### 2. Enhanced Format Recognition
- The program loader was looking for `"degree_rules"` field to identify "new format" files
- Our enhanced files use `"_program_info"` and other metadata fields
- The loader wasn't properly recognizing and processing the enhanced format

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Removed Unified Format Priority
```bash
mv data/engineering_programs_unified.json data/engineering_programs_unified.json.backup
```
- Moved the incomplete unified file to force legacy format loading
- Now uses the enhanced individual program JSON files

### 2. Enhanced Format Recognition Logic
Updated `EngineeringProgramLoader._load_legacy_format()` to:
- Detect enhanced format by checking for `"_program_info"` field
- Properly extract specializations from top-level keys (excluding metadata fields starting with `_`)
- Preserve all enhanced metadata (program_info, constraints, milestones)

```python
# Enhanced format detection and processing
if "_program_info" in program_data:
    # Enhanced format - extract specializations from top-level keys
    program_info = program_data.get("_program_info", {})
    specializations = {}
    
    # Extract all non-metadata keys as specializations
    for key, value in program_data.items():
        if not key.startswith("_"):  # Skip metadata fields
            specializations[key] = value
    
    self.programs[program_name] = {
        "program_name": program_info.get("program_name", f"Master of Engineering (MEng) in {program_name}"),
        "department": program_name,
        "specializations": specializations,
        "program_info": program_info,
        "degree_constraints": program_data.get("_degree_constraints", {}),
        "milestone_requirements": program_data.get("_milestone_requirements", {}),
        "specialization_info": program_data.get("_specialization_info", {})
    }
```

## Results After Fix

### ✅ All Programs Now Load Successfully
- **Before**: 3 programs (Systems Design, Chemical, ECE)
- **After**: 6 programs (all engineering departments)

### ✅ Complete Specialization Coverage
- **Before**: 7 specializations total
- **After**: 31 specializations total

### ✅ Enhanced Metadata Available
- Program information (names, URLs, course counts)
- Degree constraints (grade requirements, level limits)
- Milestone requirements (seminars, etc.)

## Detailed Results

| Program | Specializations | Enhanced | Status |
|---------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Systems Design Engineering | 5 | ❌ | ✅ Loaded |
| Electrical and Computer Engineering | 10 | ✅ | ✅ Loaded |
| Chemical Engineering | 5 | ✅ | ✅ Loaded |
| Civil and Environmental Engineering | 5 | ❌ | ✅ Loaded |
| Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering | 5 | ✅ | ✅ Loaded |
| Management Science and Engineering | 1 | ❌ | ✅ Loaded |

### Enhanced Programs Features Available:
- **Chemical Engineering**: Program metadata, constraints, milestones
- **ECE**: Program metadata, constraints, specialization info
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Program metadata, constraints, milestones

## Web Interface Impact

### Before Fix:
- Only 3 program options in dropdown
- Missing specializations for many programs
- Incomplete program information

### After Fix:
- All 6 engineering programs available
- Complete specialization lists (31 total)
- Enhanced programs show rich metadata
- Better user experience with complete information

## Technical Benefits

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Enhanced Features**: Rich metadata available for enhanced programs
3. **Scalability**: Easy to enhance remaining programs using same pattern
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of metadata and program structure

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
- ✅ All programs now visible in web interface
- ✅ Complete specialization coverage
- ✅ Enhanced metadata available for use

### Future Enhancements:
- Apply enhanced format to remaining 3 programs (Systems Design, Civil, Management Science)
- Utilize enhanced metadata for better UI display
- Implement constraint validation using structured data
- Add progress tracking using course count information

## Status: ✅ FIXED

**All 6 engineering programs are now properly loaded with complete specialization information. The enhanced programs provide rich metadata while maintaining full backward compatibility.**
